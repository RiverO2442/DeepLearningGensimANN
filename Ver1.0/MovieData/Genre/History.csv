The early 1990s in Eastern Germany were marked by right-wing extremist violence. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, leading neo-Nazis from West Germany met with great interest with their ideas for a brown revolution in Eastern Germany. The reasons for this lay in the concealment of a neo-Nazi scene that had already grown stronger in the 1980s and was officially not allowed to exist in the anti-fascist GDR. The failure to deal with the National Socialist past and the Holocaust in schools and in society over the past 40 years were further reasons. There was hardly any understanding of democracy. The effects: nowhere else in Germany have right-wing extremist parties like the NPD and AfD achieved such great success in the new millennium.

Using onsite documentation, costumed reenactments, interviews with prominent curators and historians, architectural models, and computer graphics, Villa Visconti Borromeo Litta portrays centuries of Italian art and architectural history in terms of stylistic expression. The film also explores the social, familial, and political milieux—not least of which is the chronicle of Pirro I Visconti Borromeo, count of Brebbia, the creator of this place of art and delights, a romantic, a patron, and a sophisticated man of culture in Milan during the late sixteenth century. The villa’s wonders are many—its famous Nymphaeum, greenhouses, palaces, sculptures, frescoes, fountains, and water features among them.",0.6,"/m99tb6Fd5JhUgaDZB0InSMD9muw.jpg","[{""id"":14016,""logo_path"":""/snclwsIZQbgvqYCBJP8fqNlCA5y.png"",""name"":""MiBAC"",""origin_country"":""IT""},{""id"":102583,""logo_path"":null,""name"":""ROADMOVIE srl"",""origin_country"":""""},{""id"":149319,""logo_path"":null,""name"":""Moovie"",""origin_country"":""BR""},{""id"":153873,""logo_path"":null,""name"":""Giardino22"",""origin_country"":""""},{""id"":153874,""logo_path"":null,""name"":""TADV2studio"",""origin_country"":""""}]","[{""iso_3166_1"":""IT"",""name"":""Italy""}]","2019-05-09",0,89,"[{""english_name"":""English"",""iso_639_1"":""en"",""name"":""English""},{""english_name"":""French"",""iso_639_1"":""fr"",""name"":""Français""},{""english_name"":""Italian"",""iso_639_1"":""it"",""name"":""Italiano""}]","Released","","Villa Visconti Borromeo Litta",false,0,0

Forty five years later a copy was discovered in the BBC vaults by an ABC producer looking for archive footage of the Opera House. Weiley was contacted and told about a film that had no sound track.

For 30 years, Alija, the miner, has been one of the many Bosnian immigrant workers. Due to the crisis, miners are losing jobs. Alija is sent to check an abandoned mine. His task is to quickly make sure the mine is empty before management sells the company. But in the mine, Alija finds hidden proof of executions after WWII. He is told to stop digging and report the mine empty. He decides to continue, although he is risking his job. Alija discovers thousands of executed people. He informs the police. He found women among the dead. Some of them were civilians, missing persons, just like his sister that was lost in the 1995 genocide in Bosnia. Alija is convinced the victims need to be brought out, identified and buried. But there is no interest in doing that. The mine is proclaimed a WWII military grave and walled in. The dead will stay unburied. Alija loses his job and struggles to preserve his dignity.",0.911,"/nAwKEFWbOa6dVXGwyoERgEWvEDu.jpg","[{""id"":111852,""logo_path"":null,""name"":""Nukleus film Slovenija"",""origin_country"":""SI""}]","[{""iso_3166_1"":""SI"",""name"":""Slovenia""},{""iso_3166_1"":""HR"",""name"":""Croatia""}]","2017-09-28",0,98,"[{""english_name"":""Slovenian"",""iso_639_1"":""sl"",""name"":""Slovenščina""}]","Released","","The Miner",false,6.5,9

His son, Corrado, a young fellow, loves Rosalia, a shepherdess, but Don Ruggero has always refused to allow their marriage and to recognize little Vincenzino, their child, as his grandchild. Finally to destroy all Corrado's hopes, he discharges poor Rosalia from his farm, where she had been employed for many years.

""Oscar Arias: Without a Shot Fired"" is a Don Quixote-like saga with great historical touchstones -- Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev, Cold War politics and Communism, Central American War and Peace. It follows a slight, academic, and most unlikely hero over the course of more than fifty years, as he travels the world in a quest to stop the spread of the weapons of war. In the end, it is a story about the triumph of reason, of the sparrow triumphing over the eagle, and how the impossible dream can sometimes come true.",0.6,"/lMPVX1e4aqiHWam5wn4WAZWqsQ3.jpg","[{""id"":96915,""logo_path"":null,""name"":""PeaceJam Productions"",""origin_country"":""""}]","[{""iso_3166_1"":""US"",""name"":""United States of America""}]","2017-06-18",0,64,"[{""english_name"":""English"",""iso_639_1"":""en"",""name"":""English""},{""english_name"":""Spanish"",""iso_639_1"":""es"",""name"":""Español""}]","Released","The story of former president of Costa Rica and 1987 Nobel Peace Prize Winner Oscar Sanchez Arias.","Oscar Arias: Without a Shot Fired",false,6,1

Exploring the royal wardrobes of our kings and queens over the last four hundred years, Lucy shows this isn't just a public fascination, but an important and powerful message from the monarchs. From Elizabeth I to the present Queen Elizabeth II, Lucy explains how the royal wardrobe's significance goes far beyond the cut and color of the clothing. Royal fashion is, and has always been, regarded as a very personal statement to reflect their power over the reign. Most kings and queens have carefully choreographed every aspect of their wardrobe; for those who have not, there have sometimes been calamitous consequences.

On October 31 of that year, a penniless monk named Martin Luther sparked the revolution that would change everything.  He had no army. In fact, he preached nonviolence so powerfully that — 400 years later — Michael King would change his name to Martin Luther King to show solidarity with the original movement.  This movement, the Protestant Reformation, changed Western culture at its core, sparking the drive toward individualism, freedom of religion, women's rights, separation of church and state, and even free public education.
