It tells the story of a nation at war from the diverse perspectives of those who lived through it: the leaders and the ordinary people, the oppressors and the victims, the guilty and the innocent.  Until recently, it was believed that no colour film of Japan existed prior to 1945. But specialist research has now unearthed a remarkable colour record from as early as the 1930s.  For eight years the Japanese fought what they believed was a Holy War that became a fight to the death.

These characters all suffer from debilitating sensitivities to their environment. Whether from ambient chemicals, genetics, electricity, or even psychogenic reasons, the cause is not clear, but the reality of the effects on these individuals is undeniable. Fortunately, Susie Molloy, a quiet firebrand who is chemically sensitive herself, seeks to help. In her, those afflicted by this modern malady have found an advocate whose mission is to de-stigmatize this community, and in telling their stories, Xanthopoulos has crafted a film itself as deeply sensitive as its title suggests.

The title refers to Chris' belief that his late father, who loathed Richard Nixon, is now friends in heaven with the former president.

Perhaps a country whose 20th Century, dominated by its authoritarian ruler Enver Hoxha, was so traumatic, should allow its film heritage to fade away? Perhaps a national forgetting should be welcomed? Influenced by the films of Chris Marker, Cousins' film broadens to consider the architecture of dictators and the great icon paintings of Onufri. In the past, when cartographers knew little about a country, they wrote on it Here be Dragons. Albania was, for decades, one of the least well know countries in the world.

Somehow, the team won the championship that year. Yet not too long after, the legacy they worked so hard for was thrown away after a group of players made a terrible decision.

The brainchild of Steve Ross (Major executive at Warner Communications) and the Ertegun brothers (Founders of Atlantic Records), the Cosmos got off to a rocky start in 1971, but things changed in 1975 when the world's most celebrated soccer star, the Brazilian champion Pele, signed with the Cosmos for a five-million-dollar payday. With the arrival of Pele, the Cosmos became a hit  and the players became the toast of the town, earning their own private table at Studio 54. A number of other international soccer stars were soon lured to the Cosmos, including Franz Beckenbauer, Rodney Marsh, and Carlos Alberto, but with the turn of the decade, the team began losing favor with fans and folded in 1985.",1.924,"/ubgZkHS1KoVILTH051zr47vMfDv.jpg","[{""id"":11594,""logo_path"":""/4w31g1L8zrpOuZ7s7f83qkmfOVZ.png"",""name"":""Passion Pictures"",""origin_country"":""GB""},{""id"":4099,""logo_path"":null,""name"":""Cactus Three"",""origin_country"":""US""},{""id"":64946,""logo_path"":null,""name"":""ESPN Original Entertainment"",""origin_country"":""US""},{""id"":2150,""logo_path"":null,""name"":""GreeneStreet Films"",""origin_country"":""US""},{""id"":3324,""logo_path"":""/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png"",""name"":""BBC"",""origin_country"":""GB""}]","[{""iso_3166_1"":""US"",""name"":""United States of America""},{""iso_3166_1"":""GB"",""name"":""United Kingdom""}]","2006-01-01",0,97,"[{""english_name"":""English"",""iso_639_1"":""en"",""name"":""English""}]","Released","The untold story of the team that had America at its feet.","Once in a Lifetime: The Extraordinary Story of the New York Cosmos",false,7,10

He describes his astonishment that, at the start of the 21st century, religious faith is gaining ground in the face of rational, scientific truth. Science, based on scepticism, investigation and evidence, must continuously test its own concepts and claims. Faith, by definition, defies evidence: it is untested and unshakeable, and is therefore in direct contradiction with science.  In addition, though religions preach morality, peace and hope, in fact, says Dawkins, they bring intolerance, violence and destruction. The growth of extreme fundamentalism in so many religions across the world not only endangers humanity but, he argues, is in conflict with the trend over thousands of years of history for humanity to progress to become more enlightened and more tolerant.",4.632,"/gOw03UkPXB7klc9XLsqFdP2Dvyj.jpg","[]","[{""iso_3166_1"":""US"",""name"":""United States of America""},{""iso_3166_1"":""IL"",""name"":""Israel""},{""iso_3166_1"":""FR"",""name"":""France""},{""iso_3166_1"":""GB"",""name"":""United Kingdom""}]","2006-01-09",0,93,"[{""english_name"":""English"",""iso_639_1"":""en"",""name"":""English""}]","Released","","Root of All Evil?",false,7.5,51
