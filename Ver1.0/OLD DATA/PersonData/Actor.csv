She earned an NAACP Image Award and a Golden Globe Award nomination for the former. She has appeared in more than 50 films.

Beals was born on the South Side of Chicago, the daughter of Jeanne (née Anderson), an elementary school teacher, and Alfred Beals, who owned grocery stores. She is multiracial; her father was African American, and her mother is Irish American. She has two brothers, Bobby and Gregory.Her father died when Beals was nine years old, and her mother married Edward Cohen in 1981. Beals has said her biracial heritage had some effect on her, as she ""always lived sort of on the outside"", with an idea ""of being the other in society"". She got her first job at age 13 at an ice cream store, using her height at the time (she is now nearly 5 ft 9 in (1.75 m)), to convince her boss she was 16.

Beals was inspired to become an actress by two events: doing a high school production of Fiddler on the Roof and seeing Balm in Gilead with Joan Allen while volunteer-ushering at the Steppenwolf Theatre.

Beals graduated from the progressive Francis W. Parker School. She also was chosen to attend the elite Goodman Theatre Young People's Drama Workshop. Beals attended Yale University, receiving a B.A. in American literature in 1987; she deferred a term so she could film Flashdance. While at Yale, Beals was a resident of Morse College.

She has English, and smaller amounts of Scottish, German, French, Scots-Irish (Northern Irish), and Powhatan Native American, ancestry.She was raised ""very strictly Pentecostal"", but later attended Catholic school for twelve years.

Her break-out role was as Valli Wooley in the 2009 film I Love You, Beth Cooper directed by Chris Columbus. Since then, she has appeared in more film and TV roles: as Kirstie in Cult, as Kim Rhodes in Hunt to Kill, and the sci-fi series The 100 as Octavia Blake.

Career

After studying broadcast journalism for two years in her hometown, Avgeropoulos moved to Europe. Several months later, she came back to Canada and settled in Vancouver. Avgeropoulos started playing drums when she was 16. One of her friends invited her for a casting call in Vancouver, which happened to be looking for drummers. A talent agent recognized her talent and invited her to appear in various national commercials. She caught the attention of director Chris Columbus. He hired Avgeropoulos for I Love You, Beth Cooper, which became her first feature film role. Her appearance in the film gave her the opportunities to star in more films and television shows.

In 2010, Avgeropoulos was cast as Kim Rhodes in the film Hunt to Kill, which became her break-out role.

false,"[""Margaret Nixon McEathron""]","""Loverly"" soprano Marni Nixon has ensured herself a proper place in film history although most moviegoers would not recognize her if they passed her on the street. But if you heard her, that might be a horse of a different color. Marni is one of those unsung heroes (or should I say ""much sung"" heroes) whose incredible talents were given short shrift at the time. For those who think film superstars such as Deborah Kerr, Natalie Wood, and Audrey Hepburn possessed not only powerhouse dramatic talents but amazing singing voices as well...think again. Kerr's Anna in The King and I (1956), Natalie's Maria in West Side Story (1961), and Audrey's Eliza in My Fair Lady (1964) were all dubbed by the amazing Marni Nixon, and nowhere in the credits will you find that fact. Born Marni McEathron in Altadena, California, she was a former child actress and soloist with the Roger Wagner Chorale in the beginning. Trained in opera, yet possessing a versatile voice for pop music and easy standards as well, she not only sang for Arnold Schönberg and Igor Stravinsky but also recorded light songs. Marni made her Broadway musical debut in 1954 in a show that lasted two months but nothing came from it. In 1955, the singer contracted to dub Deborah Kerr in The King and I (1956) was killed in a car accident in Europe and a replacement was needed. Marni was hired...and the rest is history. Much impressed, the studios brought her in to ""ghost"" Ms. Kerr's voice once again in the classic tearjerker An Affair to Remember (1957). From there she went on to make Natalie Wood and Audrey Hepburn sound incredibly good with such classic songs as ""Tonight"" and ""Wouldn't It Be Loverly.""

She finally appeared on screen in a musical in The Sound of Music (1965) starring Julie Andrews, who physically resembles Marni. The role is a small one, however, and she is only given a couple of solo lines in ""How Do You Solve a Problem Like Maria?"" as a singing nun. Marni's vocal career in films dissolved by the mid 1960s, but she continued on with concerts and in symphony halls, while billing herself as ""The Voice of Hollywood"" in one-woman cabaret shows. Throughout the years, she has played on the legit stage, including the lead roles in ""The King and I"" and ""The Sound of Music,"" and in her matronly years has been seen as Fraulein Schneider in ""Cabaret,"" and in the musicals ""Follies"" and ""70 Girls 70."" Her last filmed singing voice was as the grandmother in the animated feature Mulan (1998) in the 1990s. Married three times, twice to musicians; one of her husbands, Ernest Gold, by whom she had three children, was a film composer and is best known for his Academy Award-winning epic Exodus (1960).

Widely regarded as one of the greatest players in the history of the sport, he was one of the two joint winners of the FIFA Player of the 20th Century award. Maradona's vision, passing, ball control, and dribbling skills were combined with his small stature, which gave him a low centre of gravity allowing him to manoeuvre better than most other players. His presence and leadership on the field had a great effect on his team's general performance, while he would often be singled out by the opposition. In addition to his creative abilities, he possessed an eye for goal and was known to be a free kick specialist. A precocious talent, Maradona was given the nickname ""El Pibe de Oro"" (""The Golden Boy""), a name that stuck with him throughout his career. He also had a troubled off-field life and was banned in both 1991 and 1994 for abusing drugs.

An advanced playmaker who operated in the classic number 10 position, Maradona was the first player to set the world record transfer fee twice: in 1982 when he transferred to Barcelona for £5 million, and in 1984 when he moved to Napoli for a fee of £6.9 million. He played for Argentinos Juniors, Boca Juniors, Barcelona, Napoli, Sevilla, and Newell's Old Boys during his club career, and is most famous for his time at Napoli where he won numerous accolades.

In his international career with Argentina, he earned 91 caps and scored 34 goals. Maradona played in four FIFA World Cups, including the 1986 World Cup in Mexico, where he captained Argentina and led them to victory over West Germany in the final, and won the Golden Ball as the tournament's best player. In the 1986 World Cup quarter final, he scored both goals in a 2–1 victory over England that entered football history for two different reasons. The first goal was an unpenalized handling foul known as the ""Hand of God"", while the second goal followed a 60 m (66 yd) dribble past five England players, voted ""Goal of the Century"" by FIFA.com voters in 2002.

Maradona became the coach of Argentina's national football team in November 2008. He was in charge of the team at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa before leaving at the end of the tournament. He then coached Dubai-based club Al Wasl in the UAE Pro-League for the 2011–12 season. In 2017, Maradona became the coach of Fujairah before leaving at the end of the season. In May 2018, Maradona was announced as the new chairman of Belarusian club Dynamo Brest. He arrived in Brest and was presented by the club to start his duties in July. From September 2018 to June 2019, Maradona was coach of Mexican club Dorados. He was the coach of Argentine Primera División club Gimnasia de La Plata from September 2019 until his death in November 2020.

As a player, he won the Ballon d'Or three times, in 1971, 1973, and 1974. Cruyff was a proponent of the football philosophy known as Total Football explored by Rinus Michels, and is widely regarded as one of the greatest players in the history of the sport, and the greatest manager ever.

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Dutch football rose from a semi-professional and obscure level to become a powerhouse in the sport. Cruyff led the Netherlands to the final of the 1974 FIFA World Cup and received the Golden Ball as player of the tournament. At the 1974 finals, he executed a feint that subsequently was named after him, the ""Cruyff Turn"", a move widely replicated in the modern game. After finishing third in UEFA Euro 1976, Cruyff refused to play in the 1978 World Cup after a kidnapping attempt targeting him and his family in their Barcelona home dissuaded him from football. At club level, Cruyff started his career at Ajax, where he won eight Eredivisie titles, three European Cups, and one Intercontinental Cup. In 1973, he moved to Barcelona for a world record transfer fee, helping the team win La Liga in his first season, and was named European Footballer of the Year. After retiring from playing in 1984, Cruyff became highly successful as manager of Ajax and later Barcelona; he remained an influential advisor to both clubs after his coaching tenures. His son Jordi also played football professionally.

Wearing the number 14 jersey since 1970, (except at Barcelona and Feyenoord where he was assigned number 9 and 10 respectively) Cruyff set a trend by players to, if allowed, choose a jersey number outside the usual starting line-up of one to eleven. In 1999, Cruyff was voted European Player of the Century in an election held by the International Federation of Football History & Statistics, and came second behind Pelé in their World Player of the Century poll. He came third in a vote organised by the French magazine France Football consulting their former Ballon d'Or winners to elect their Football Player of the Century. He was included in the World Team of the 20th Century in 1998, the FIFA World Cup Dream Team in 2002, and in 2004 was named in the FIFA 100 list of the world's greatest living players.

Considered to be one of the most influential figures in football history, Cruyff's style of play and football philosophy has influenced managers and players alike. Ajax and Barcelona are among the clubs that have developed youth academies based on Cruyff's coaching methods. His coaching philosophy helped lay the foundations for the revival of Ajax's international successes in the 1990s, and Spanish football's successes at both club and international levels during the years 2008 to 2012 have been cited as evidence of Cruyff's impact on contemporary football. And in Johan Neeskens's own words, ""If you look at the greatest players in history, most of them couldn't coach. If you look at the greatest coaches in history, most of them were not great players. Johan Cruyff did both – and in such an exhilarating style.""

Lionel Andrés ""Leo"" Messi (Spanish pronunciation: [ljoˈnel anˈdɾes ˈmesi] ( listen); born 24 June 1987) is an Argentine professional footballer who plays as a forward for French club Paris Saint-Germain and captains the Argentina national team. Often considered the best player in the world and rated by many in the sport as the greatest of all time, Messi is the only football player in history to win five FIFA Ballons d'Or, four of which he won consecutively, and the first player to win three European Golden Shoes.[note 2] With Barcelona he has won eight La Liga titles and four UEFA Champions League titles, as well as four Copas del Rey. Both a prolific goalscorer and a creative playmaker, Messi holds the records for most goals scored in La Liga, a La Liga season (50), and a football season (82), as well as those for most assists made in La Liga and the Copa América. He has scored over 500 senior career goals for club and country.

Born and raised in central Argentina, Messi was diagnosed with a growth hormone deficiency as a child. At age 13, he relocated to Spain to join Barcelona, who agreed to pay for his medical treatment. After a fast progression through Barcelona's youth academy, Messi made his competitive debut aged 17 in October 2004. Despite being injury-prone during his early career, he established himself as an integral player for the club within the next three years, finishing 2007 as a finalist for both the Ballon d'Or and FIFA World Player of the Year award, a feat he repeated the following year. His first uninterrupted campaign came in the 2008–09 season, during which he helped Barcelona achieve the first treble in Spanish football. At 22 years old, Messi won the Ballon d'Or and FIFA World Player of the Year award by record voting margins.","1987-06-24",,2,"https://messi.com/",1127406,"nm2177779","Acting","Lionel Messi","Rosario, Argentina",6.401,"/a1EuvL7XzKDXRPe0a6CEMJWF6Vd.jpg",,,

Mike Horner (born February 3, 1955) is an American pornographic actor. He is sometimes credited as Don Hart, Don Horner, ""Dan Sir"", or Johnny Wilson.

Mike Horner began acting in small sex films, at the time referred to as loops (named after the style of their presentation, constantly looped 16mm films shown in booths), in January 1978. His first feature movie was 1979's Tangerine. He has been in over 1500 feature (story based) films and videos, and performed in over 500 additional all sex videos, with approximately 1800 actresses. He attended San Francisco State University, UCLA, and graduated from Sonoma State University. He pursued acting, theatre, and dance prior to his porn career, but became more involved after his exposure to adult films. Mike started out making only around $40–100 a movie. While only a sideline job at first, hardcore finally became Mike's primary income in 1983. He made the move to Southern California in 1991 to make porn his primary objective.

He started directing movies in 1993, but found mixed success, as porn made the move to gonzo type movies, different from his artistic tastes. He has directed ""Tangled"" (1993, Pleasure Prod.), ""Dreams of Desires"" (owned by him but not legally available), ""Taoist Sexuality"" (1999, Adam &amp; Eve), and 13 other feature videos. He is a member of the AVN and XRCO Halls of Fame.

He has won Best Actor/best supporting actor and non-sex acting awards from the AVN eight times, as well as several European awards. His AVN best actor award winning films include, ""Sexually Altered States"" (1985), Justine:Nothing to Hide"" (1993, Vivid), ""Seduction of Mary"" 1995, VCA Pictures), ""Lessons in Love"" (1996, HeatWave), and ""Euphoria"" (2000, Wicked). He continues to act and produce adult films periodically. He was born in Portland, Oregon and was adopted.

In 2009 he co-starred in the spoof Celebrity Pornhab with Dr. Screw.

true,"[""Julia Ann Tavella"",""Джулия Энн""]","​When people describe an encounter with adult film legend Julia Ann, they often express sentiments to the effect of, ""She is simply one of the most beautiful, nicest people I've ever met,"" as if someone of such iconic importance couldn't also be down-to-earth, personable, and approachable. People with such a mystique and reputation aren't typically like Julia Ann. In fact, there is no one else quite like her. Julia Ann's 2002 debut as a Wicked Girl was in Jonathan Morgan's big-budget historical comedy Hercules, which garnered an AVN Nomination for Best Sex Comedy. The ambitious performer's follow-ups to this performance include Brad Armstrong's Class Act and Porn Star, Toni English's Love & War, and Morgan's romantic drama The Assignment. The sultry blonde-haired, blue-eyed Californian has also reaped much success on Playboy TV, where her many appearances have included a multi-year hosting association with Playboy's Naughty Amateur Home Videos.  In one of her most noted Wicked productions, the aptly titled Beautiful, this skilled actress delivers what many consider to be one of the definitive roles of her career. It was the emotional range, depth, and sustained intensity of her bravura performance that allowed Julia Ann to walk home with a richly deserved trophy for Best Actress after the 2004 AVN Awards in Las Vegas. This would be the second of three consecutive years wherein Julia Ann was nominated for Best Actress. She had been nominated in 2003 for Paradise Lost and would be nominated again in 2005 for Killer Sex & Suicide Blondes. Julia Ann was also inducted into the AVN Hall of Fame in 2004. While many veteran performers of her caliber would have been content to retire after such a career milestone, Julia Ann has worked to perfect her craft. She has continued to create and star in new projects, a point beautifully illustrated in 2005's designer release Wicked Divas: Julia Ann, The Legend.  In addition to her many triumphs in adult, Julia Ann has also starred in the R-rated cult-film favorite Veronica 2020, worked on the wildly successful 20th Century Fox romantic comedy The Girl Next Door, modeled for the cover of the Mercedes-Benz lifestyle magazine Benzo, and been a nation-wide spokesmodel for Third Rail Clothing.  A deeply intellectual, introspective woman with a heart for others, Julia Ann often involves herself in selfless acts of charity. When the adult industry was rocked by a health crisis in 2002, Julia Ann restarted Blondage, her legendary dance duo with Janine, and organized a benefit for the Adult Industry Assistance Fund. They earned thousands of dollars in donations in just one evening. Today, Julia Ann continues to participate in groundbreaking projects, whether it's appearing on radio for charity (she raised thousands of dollars for the Million Minute March, a national charity designed to provide overseas troops with phone cards) or giving career-best performances in such releases as Julia Ann: Hardcore and Around The World In 7 Days. With a classy look that showcases her stunning eyes and flowing hair, Julia Ann continues to explore her sexuality in such projects as Randy Spears' Touched and the upcoming July release Melt.  For this legend, the best is truly yet to come!","1969-10-08",,1,,135341,"nm0030214","Acting","Julia Ann","Los Angeles, California, USA",26.014,"/z1FnWfQFBTX52hrcoJvaDmJfgRc.jpg",,,

She started acting in erotic videos in 1993 after having worked as a stripper and glamour model. By 1996, she had won the ""top newcomer"" award from each of the three major adult movie organizations. She has since won more than 20 adult video awards, and has been inducted into both the X-Rated Critics Organization (XRCO) and Adult Video News (AVN) Halls of Fame.

Jameson founded the adult-entertainment company ClubJenna in 2000 with Jay Grdina, whom she later married and divorced. Initially a single website, this business expanded into managing similar websites of other stars and began producing sexually explicit videos in 2001. The first such movie, Briana Loves Jenna (with Briana Banks), was named at the 2003 AVN Awards as the best-selling and best-renting pornographic title for 2002. By 2005, ClubJenna had revenues of US$30 million with profits estimated at half that. Advertisements for her site and films, often bearing her picture, have towered on a 48-foot-tall billboard in New York City's Times Square. Playboy TV hosts her Jenna's American Sex Star reality show where aspiring porn stars compete for a Club Jenna contract.

Jameson has also crossed over into mainstream pop culture, starting with a minor role in Howard Stern's 1997 film Private Parts. Her mainstream appearances continued with: regular appearances on The Howard Stern Show; guest-hosting stints on E! television's Wild On! and Talk Soup programs; a guest-starring voice-over role in a 2001 episode of the Fox animated television sitcom Family Guy; an award-winning voice-over role in the 2002 video game Grand Theft Auto: Vice City; and, a guest-starring role in two episodes of the 2003 NBC television series Mister Sterling. Her 2004 autobiography, How to Make Love Like a Porn Star: A Cautionary Tale, spent six weeks on The New York Times Best Seller list. She has also created a horror comic book with Virgin Comics entitled Jenna Jameson's Shadow Hunter, released in February 2008. She played the female lead character in the 2008 horror-comedy Zombie Strippers. Jameson is considering a singing/acting career on Broadway in the Tony-nominated musical Rock of Ages.

Whether it was reciting lines of William Shakespeare in the community theater or awing her family with piano recitals of Sergei Rachmaninoff's concertos, Chanel fed off the energy of the crowd. Dancing, painting and playing the trumpet were additional ways she experienced the performance high. Now she captures the same feeling starring in adult movies.

This daring attitude led her to join the wrestling team in high school, despite the coach's resentment about having a girl on the team. Raised with the concept of gender equality, Chanel got her first taste of discrimination on the gym mats. The further she was pushed to fail, the more she determined to succeed--an attribute still strong within her.

A former Catholic schoolgirl, Sandra became a stripper in her late teens then started her show business career in her early 20s wrestling for Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling (G.L.O.W.) under the stage name Tiffany Mellon; usually as part of the tag team ""Park Avenue Knockouts."" However, she left prematurely after facing harassment and homophobia from a G.L.O.W. manager who thought she and another wrestler were lesbians. Still, TV exposure on the syndicated series landed her her very first acting roles, including a guest spot on My Two Days and a supporting part in the wrestling drama American Angels: Baptism of Blood in 1989. Now bitten by the acting bug, Sandra switched her professional name yet again to Sandra Margot and started carving out a niche for herself in B movies. She played a seductive demon in Demon Wind, a hellish nun in Spirits, a teenage murder victim in The Sleeping Car and also landed parts in the women-in-prison film Caged Fury and a few other films, plus played a stripper on TV's Tales from the Crypt. The only constant were that the roles were small and almost always required nudity.

Likely sick of landing nothing but nondescript bits in low budget films, Margot left her mainstream film aspirations behind, changed her name again to Tiffany Million (sometimes Tyffany Million) and went where she could become a star: hardcore porn. There she was much more successful and, from 1992 until her final X film appearance in 1997, Sandra became one of the most in demand adult stars of the decade. Some of her most successful ventures were American Garter, New Wave Hookers III, Sex, Latex (the top-selling adult video of 1995) and its 1996 sequel Shock. She even poked fun at her former wrestling days with a film called B.L.O.W. (Beautiful Ladies of Wrestling). Sandra won an XRCO (X-Rated Critics Organization) Award, two AVN Awards and even directed, wrote and produced a handful of films, including The XXX Files: Lust in Space (1995), for her own production company Immaculate Video Conceptions. After receiving a sizable inheritance, she quit the adult film industry and never returned.

Leaving her sex star days behind, Sandra became a bounty hunter, bail bondswoman and then a private investigator. She emerged yet again a decade later, this time as Sandra Scott (surname from her fourth husband), as star of the short-lived reality show Wife, Mom, Bounty Hunter, which aired on the WE Network in 2007. Afterward, Sandra was interviewed about her adult film days in After Porn Ends (2012) and has reinvented herself yet again in 2017, also using a new name (""Margot Monday""), as the host of Arizona talk radio show.","1966-04-06",,1,,100459,"nm0546831","Acting","Tiffany Million","Richmond, California, USA",4.387,"/9sd3sC6C90H8AfKrwnb1ffSfDLh.jpg",,,

Usually credited under the name John Leslie, he has also worked under a variety of pseudonyms, including John Leslie Dupre, Frederick Watson, and Lenny Lovely.

Beginning with 1973's 'Sensuous Delights', Leslie was a performer in almost 300 adult films. He won numerous awards during his days as a performer. He appeared with some of the era's most noted porn stars, including Seka, Kay Parker, and Annette Haven. His most noteworthy roles were in 'Talk Dirty To Me' (1980), 'Nothing To Hide' (1981), and 'Talk Dirty To Me, Part II' (1982). He was one of the first porn actors to make the transition from performing to directing, beginning with 1987's 'Nightshift Nurses'. Since then he directed more than 90 adult movies, including 'The Chameleon' (1989), 'Curse of the Catwoman' (1992), 'Dog Walker' (1994), and 'Drop Sex' (1997), along with the 'Voyeur', 'Fresh Meat' and 'Crack Her Jack' series. He won many awards for his work behind the cameras as well. Though much of his recent work, in keeping with current trends in adult video, has been in the gonzo genre, such as the 'Fresh Meat' and 'Crack Her Jack' series, Leslie has continued to make feature films, or 'sex dramas'; most recently, in 2007 he directed the film 'Brianna Love, Her Fine, Sexy Self'.

In the early 1970s, he was a vocalist and harmonica player for the 'The Brooklyn Blues Busters', a southeastern Michigan-based musical group sometimes accompanying John Lee Hooker. 'The Brooklyn Blues Busters' were the backing band for Victoria Spivey during the 1973 Ann Arbor Blues and Jazz Festival. Nuzzo also worked as a bartender in the early 1970s at Mr. Flood's Party, in Ann Arbor, Michigan. He was a member of the AVN, Legends of Erotica and XRCO Halls of Fame. John Leslie died on December 5, 2010, from a heart attack, at his home in Mill Valley, California at the age of 65.

Harrison Ford’s career started in 1964 when he travelled to California in search of a voice-over job. He never received that position, but instead signed a contract with Columbia Pictures where he earned $150 weekly to play small fill in roles in various films.

Through the 60’s Harrison worked on several TV shows including Gunsmoke, Ironside, Kung Fu, and American Style. It wasn’t until 1967 that Harrison received his first credited role in the Western film, A Time for Killing. Dissatisfied with the meager roles he was being offered, Ford took a hiatus from acting to work as a self-employed carpenter. This seemingly odd diversion turned out to be a blessing in disguise for Harrison’s acting career when he was soon hired by famous film producer George Lucas. This was a turning point in Harrison’s life that led to him be casted in milestone roles such as Hans Solo and Indiana Jones.

Since his most famous roles in the Star Wars Trilogy and Raiders of the Lost Ark, Harrison Ford has starred in over 40 films. Many criticize his recent work, saying his performances have been lackluster leading to commercially disappointing films. Harrison has always worked hard to protect his off-screen private life, keeping details about his children and marriages quite.

Naturalized by marriage and settled in Italy, Staller met pornographer Riccardo Schicchi in the early 1970s, and, beginning in 1973, achieved fame with a radio show called “Voulez-vous coucher avec moi?” on Radio Luna. For that program she adopted the name Cicciolina. She referred to her male fanbase, and later the male members of the Italian parliament, as “cicciolini”, translating loosely as “little tubby boys.” Although she appeared in several films from 1970, she made her debut under her own name in 1975 with “La liceale” (aka The Teasers) playing a lesbian classmate of Gloria Guida. In 1978, on the RAI show “C'era due volte,” her breasts were the first to be bared live on Italian TV. Staller appeared in her first hardcore pornographic film, “Telefono rosso” (Red Telephone) in 1983. She produced the film together with Schicchi's company Diva Futura. Her memoirs were published as “Confessioni erotiche di Cicciolina,” which translates as Erotic Confessions of Cicciolina, by the Olympia Press of Milan in 1987. That same year she appeared in “Carne bollente,” called The Rise and Fall of the Roman Empress in the United States, co-starring John Holmes.

He is currently signed to WWE, where he performs on the SmackDown brand under the ring name Roman Reigns. He is the current and longest reigning WWE Universal Champion in his second reign. He is part of the Anoaʻi wrestling family, which also includes his father Sika Anoaʻi, brother Rosey, and cousins Jey Uso, Jimmy Uso, Rikishi, The Tonga Kid, and the late Yokozuna and Umaga. Highly regarded by industry veterans, his heel run has been regarded as one of the greatest character arcs of professional wrestling. After playing college football for Georgia Tech, Anoaʻi started his professional football career with brief off-season stints with the Minnesota Vikings and Jacksonville Jaguars of the National Football League (NFL) in 2007. He then played a full season for the Canadian Football League's (CFL) Edmonton Eskimos in 2008 before his release and retirement from football. He then pursued a career in professional wrestling and was signed by WWE in 2010, reporting to their developmental territory Florida Championship Wrestling (FCW). Under the ring name Roman Reigns, he made his main roster debut in November 2012 alongside Dean Ambrose and Seth Rollins as The Shield. The trio teamed together until June 2014, after which Reigns entered singles competition. Reigns is a five-time world champion in WWE, having held the WWE World Heavyweight Championship three times and the WWE Universal Championship twice. In 2022, he became the longest reigning Universal Champion at 581+ days, which is recognized as the sixth-longest world championship reign in the promotion's history. He is also a one-time WWE United States Champion, a one-time WWE Intercontinental Champion, a one-time WWE Tag Team Champion (with Rollins), the 2015 Royal Rumble winner, and the 2014 Superstar of the Year. He tied the WWE record for most eliminations in a Survivor Series match with four in the 2013 event and also previously held the record for most eliminations in a Royal Rumble match with 12 in the 2014 event. Upon winning the Intercontinental Championship, he became the twenty-eighth Triple Crown Champion and the seventeenth Grand Slam Champion. Reigns has headlined numerous pay-per-view events, including WWE's flagship event WrestleMania five times (31, 32, 33, 34, and 37). Additionally, Reigns was ranked number one in Pro Wrestling Illustrated's annual PWI 500 list of the top 500 singles wrestlers in 2016. From 2014 onwards, WWE attempted to establish Reigns as their next ""face of the company"", positioning him as a heroic character, which was met with intense disapproval by audiences and critics. However, following his return in August 2020, Reigns was repackaged as a new villainous character, ""The Tribal Chief"", which has generally been met with acclaim by fans and critics alike.

Steve Eastin (born June 22, 1948) is an American character actor. He has appeared in nearly 150 television and film roles throughout his decades long career.

Eastin was born in Colorado, where he began to study acting at the young age of six at his local theater. He received his Actor Equity card at age 16 when he performed in two musicals choreographed by Micheal Bennet. Later, he attended the University of Northern Colorado where he appeared in several productions at the Little Theater of the Rockies, whose alumni include Nick Nolte.

After college, Eastin received a fellowship to teach at the University of Arizona where he appeared in his first SAG role opposite Clint Eastwood in Joe Kidd. It was shortly after this when Eastin moved to Los Angeles to further pursue his acting career, enrolling in the Charles Conrad Studio upon arrival in 1974.

While attending Charles' class, Eastin became interested in teaching acting as well. In 1991, he founded his own acting school, The Steve Eastin Studio. The studio believes in what Eastin refers to as ""Choiceless Awareness"", where the actors do not read into the script, nor prepare their ""beats"" or think about what or how they may read their lines. Instead, the actors are encouraged to be in the moment and let their natural, emotional power take over and thus tap into the vast collective unconscious all humans are capable of attuning themselves to.

Eastin is best known for appearing in such films as Field of Dreams (1989), Con Air (1997) and A Man Apart (2003), where he developed a reputation as the tough guy with a heart of gold underneath. He played opposite Leonardo Dicaprio in two pivotal scenes in Catch Me if You Can (2002). Eastin has worked with such directors as Steven Spielberg, Brian De Palma, and Jason Reitman.

Eastin is also known for his numerous television appearances throughout the years on such shows as Little House on the Prairie, CHiPS, T.J. Hooker, St. Elsewhere and L.A. Law.

Chapa was born in Dayton, Ohio, USA. He was briefly married to Natasha Henstridge. Among his earlier notable film roles are one of the leads in Taylor Hackford's Blood In Blood Out and the part of Ken in the film adaptation of Street Fighter. Subsequently, Chapa has directed and produced, in addition to starring in, his own films. These movies include 1998's Kill You Twice, 2000's The Lonely Life of Downey Hall, 2002's Man of Faith, 2004's Shade of Pale, 2004's El Padrino, and 2006's I.R.A.: King of Nothing.

Chapa co-wrote and directed Polanski Unauthorized, a biopic of Roman Polanski, in which he played the title role. It was released on February 13, 2009, in Los Angeles, California. Chapa will begin filming the only film about Marlon Brando ever to be made, in June 2010 called Brando Unauthorized. He followed this with ""Vatos Locos"", starring himself. Albert Pyun was supposed to direct, but left the project following a dispute over his salary, so Chapa directed himself. The film is about the Chinese mafia in Los Angeles and how the Mexican gang boys, known as ""vatos,"" fought back and defeated the Chinese gang-bangers.

As of 2011, Chapa has yet another project in development, an indie drama titled ""The Best So Far,"" which takes place in the late 80's, about a small-town Canadian girl who loves Judo and dreams about being one of the finalists at the '88 Olympics. The ensemble drama follows the lines of Rocky, in the sense that it's not about winning, but going the distance and getting your life back. Chapa, who wrote the drama, will play the widowed father, who does his best to make life easier for his daughter. Although the film is in its very early development stages, Chapa hopes the script will attract the interest of talented artists such as Ellen Page for the main role and Jennifer Connelly for the supporting role, this being the part of the final, toughest competition Page's character faces off during the '88 Olympics and gets defeated by. Although not winning, she gets her sense of victory be offering a brave stand against the better fighter, and both discover, in the process, they are quite simillar, despite their differences. Insiders who had a chance to read the script stated that it is one of the finest not-yet-filmed scripts they had ever seen. Acclaimed director David Cronenberg asked for New Line to bid for the script, but Chapa wouldn't sell it, because of his determination to direct the picture himself. The project is slated to be shot sometime in mid-2012, for tentative release in 2013 at the Sundance Film Festival.

Her best-known roles are the redeemable bad girls in Jackie Chan's Rumble in the Bronx and Jet Li's Black Mask. The critical and financial success of Rumble in the Bronx (and its subsequent number-one box-office bow in the United States) made Yip an instant success and garnered her two Hong Kong Film Award nominations. She continued to do movies and star in TV, but her roles were less known or temporary. The characters she plays often get killed or serve as a background character. Yip appeared in the television series Andromeda as two different characters. Her first character was arrested, and her final character was murdered. She did two movies with Jet Li, the first as a lead romantic interest in Black Mask and the second in Romeo Must Die, but this time she played a Chinese gangster motorcycle assassin killed by Jet Li and Aaliyah. An unfortunate aspect of her career is that none of the TV shows she starred in lasted beyond a full season, and if she did have a starring role in a movie it was a straight-to-video/DVD film. Her most recent appearance was in the new Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem movie, and she guest-starred in the Canadian TV show Blood Ties.

Cobb (December 8, 1911 - February 11, 1976) ) was an American actor best known for his performance in 12 Angry Men (1957), his Academy Award-nominated performance in On the Waterfront, and one of his last films, The Exorcist (1973). He also played the role of Willy Loman in the original Broadway production of Arthur Miller's 1949 play Death of a Salesman under the direction of Elia Kazan. On television, Cobb costarred in the first four seasons of the popular, long-running western series The Virginian. He typically played arrogant, intimidating, and abrasive characters, but often had roles as respectable figures such as judges.  Born Leo Jacob in New York City, he grew up in The Bronx,  before studying at New York University and making his film debut in The Vanishing Shadow (1934).  Cobb performed in numerous theater productions and companies, including Group Theatre (New York) before serving in the First Motion Picture Unit of the Army Air Force during World War II.  

Following the war, Cobb returned to film, television and theater before being accused of being a Communist in 1951 testimony before the House Un-American Activities Committee by Larry Parks, himself a former Communist Party member. Cobb was called to testify before HUAC but refused to do so for two years until, with his career threatened by the blacklist, he relented in 1953 and gave testimony in which he named 20 people as former members of the Communist Party USA. Following the hearing he resumed his career and worked with Elia Kazan and Budd Schulberg, two other HUAC ""friendly witnesses"", on the 1954 film On the Waterfront, which is widely seen as an allegory and apologia for testifying.  His 1968 performance as King Lear achieved the longest run (72 performances) for the play in Broadway history.  One of his final film roles was that of police detective Lt. Kinderman in the 1973 horror film The Exorcist.

Cobb died of a heart attack in February 1976 in Woodland Hills, California, and was buried in Mount Sinai Memorial Park Cemetery in Los Angeles. He was survived by his second wife, Mary Hirsch, and daughter, also an accomplished actress, Julie Cobb.","1911-12-08","1976-02-11",2,,5248,"nm0002011","Acting","Lee J.

Stardom followed several years later with her acclaimed role in The Last Picture Show (1971), which earned her a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress.

The film has remained popular and several publications have regarded it as one of the greatest horror films of all time. She followed this with Martin Scorsese's Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore (1974), which won her the Academy Award for Best Actress.

She appeared in numerous television films and gained further recognition from her performances in Same Time, Next Year (1978), which won her a Golden Globe Award, and Resurrection (1980), How to Make an American Quilt (1995), and Requiem For a Dream (2000).

In 2005, Kennedy won a recurring role on the popular ABC primetime soap, Desperate Housewives where he played Caleb Applewhite, a fugitive who was being held captive in his mother's (Alfre Woodard) basement. However shortly after in November 2005, Kennedy was fired from Desperate Housewives; Kennedy himself claimed that Touchstone Television, the producers of the show, wanted to take a new direction with the character and bought out his contract. He was replaced by NaShawn Kearse. The producers indicated it was due to sexual misconduct, given his screen time at the time his contract was cancelled amounted to no more than a few seconds.

Kennedy joined the cast of Showtime's hit series Weeds during its second and third season. He played the drug-dealer and self-described ""thug"", ""U-Turn"".

Kennedy played a gay inmate and gang leader in My Name is Earl and a married inmate and ex-con in Raising the Bar.

Along with award-winning performances in French cinema and television, she has appeared in major films including Inglorious Basterds, Robin Hood, Midnight in Paris, and Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol. In 2013 she shared the Palme d'Or prize at the Cannes Film Festival for the film Blue is the Warmest Color. It was announced in early 2014 that Lea will be nominated for the Rising Star Award of the BAFTAs.

Early life

Léa Seydoux is the daughter of businessman Henri Seydoux and Valérie Schlumberger. She has five younger siblings and an older sister, Camille. Seydoux was born in the Parisian district of Passy, but grew up in Saint-Germain-des-Prés. Her parents divorced when she was a small child. Through her family involvement in media and entertainment, Seydoux grew up acquainted with prominent artists such as photographer Nan Goldin, Lou Reed, and Mick Jagger.

The Seydoux family is widely known in France. Her grandfather, Jérôme Seydoux, is the chairman of Pathé; her granduncle, Nicolas Seydoux, is the chairman of Gaumont Film Company; her other granduncle, Michel Seydoux, also a cinema producer, is currently the chairman of the Lille football club, LOSC; and her father is CEO of the French wireless company Parrot.

Her mother Valérie Schlumberger is a former actress and the founder of the boutique CSAO (Compagnie d'Afrique du Sénégal et de l'Afrique de l'ouest), which promotes the work of African artists, and Seydoux once worked as a model for their jewelry line Jokko. Schlumberger, who lived in Senegal as a teenager, is also the founder of the charitable organization ASAO (Association pour le Sénégal et l'Afrique de l'Ouest).

Seydoux describes her youthful self as short-haired, slightly disheveled, and widely viewed as a bit strange: ""People liked me, but I always felt like a misfit."" Still concerned for her shyness in adulthood, Seydoux has admitted to having had an anxiety crisis during the 2009 Cannes Film Festival.","1985-07-01",,1,,121529,"nm2244205","Acting","Léa Seydoux","Passy, Paris, France",23.775,"/tUfoM95x70Qsb1ElClPSpSrZQ2v.jpg",,,

Attending St Aloysius College, he developed a love for being a creative, which was followed by studying software and web design. Having always felt the urge to perform and entertain from a young age, Davide drew his inspiration from the actors, singers and public figures throughout his upbringing.

Singing was always Davide’s passion and helped him break into the industry. His first role was in the hit musical “Spring Awakening” (2010) at St James Theatre as Georg. A successful run of the award winning show confirmed his love for the arts, as well as launched him unexpectedly into  a modeling career.

“La Famiglia” (2011) the Maltese television crime drama was Davide’s first small screen role, portraying Valentino Saraceni. Later in 2012 he was involved in the very successful prime-time TVM (Television Malta) series “Katrina” (2012- 14) where he played the role of the visually impaired Clyde Montaldo, who was received warmly by the audience. Also taking on roles in theatre such as, “Jiena Nhobb, Inti Thobb” (2014) an original Maltese play by Simon Bartolo that deals with sexuality, religion and morality - in which Davide plays the controversial role of Devin. Later that year, he also worked in the Maltese/ Canadian eOne production of “A Dangerous Arrangement” (2015), working alongside actors such as Colm Meaney and Deborah Kara Unger. This film saw Davide take on the character of Tommaso - a young farmer working for the wealthy Vreeland family, who saves his co-star from drowning and deals with a father looking for vengeance.

In 2015, Davide starred in TVM most watched prime-time television programme, ‘Ic-Caqqufa’ (2015- 16), he played the role of Alex, a loner who finds refuge from the materialism of society with his love for horses.

The following year, he took on the role of John in “Limestone Cowboy” (2016), who goes through a rollercoaster of emotions throughout the film, as he is torn between the relationship with his delusional father and that of his growing child as a single parent. This role allowed him to feature in a film that truly showed off Malta’s home grown cultural aspect. An on-going demand in theatre has seen him undertake a role in Malcolm Gelea’s “Marti Martek, Martek Marti” - a theatrical sex-comedy, where Davide portrays a cocky, sexually adventurous Owen, then dove straight into the iconic Demetrius, an arrogant, self-centred youth, who then falls in love with the woman he initially despises in William Shakespeare's “A Midsummer Night’s Dream” (2016), performed in the presidential gardens of San Anton in honour of William Shakespeare’s 400th anniversary from his death.

Soon after his birth, the family moved back to Israel where he grew up as an artistic kid, taking up painting, sculpting, photography and playing the guitar. But it wasn't until after his military service of 4.5 years that he decided to give art a serious try and enrolled in Tel Aviv University Film School. A short film he made there, A Nightmare on Bialik Street (1994) (a witty homage to the famous Russian film Battleship Potemkin (1925)), won several prizes and was later shown at the Cannes Film Festival. While acting in his own films, Aylam caught the 'acting bug' and so in early 2000 he returned to the US to study acting at The Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute, and later The Stella Adler Studio of Acting in New York.

While a student at the Strasberg Institute, he was hired to organize and preserve Strasberg's extensive collections of materials on acting - a position he held for the next 9 years, before starting to teach there. Upon graduating, he made his TV debut in the A&E mini-series Between the Lines (2004) hosted by Robert Downey Jr., where he joined the ranks of Hillary Clinton, John Goodman and Priscilla Presley in reading unknown letters written by famous people - his was no other than a love letter written by a young Adolf Hitler. Soon after, he played the leading role of a fugitive on the popular Fox show America's Most Wanted: America Fights Back (1988). He also wrote, produced and played the leading role in the movement-theatre show and film Beautiful World... (2006). Other film and TV roles followed, such as in the independent films Color of Truth (2009), Joy Incorporated (2012), Keep the Lights On (2012), and The Cold Winter (2016); the CBS film In God's Name (2007), and the hit NBC comedy show 30 Rock (2006), before Aylam made his way to Los Angeles.

There, he kicked things into high gear with multiple co-star and guest-star roles on such shows as Code Black (2015), NCIS: Los Angeles (2009), Shooter (2016), and The Guest Book (2017), while also lending his multilingual skills to ADR on numerous other TV shows and films. In 2017, Aylam filmed a supporting role opposite Rosamund Pike in the upcoming thriller The Informer (2019), and the series regular role of the villain in the new installment of the ""Stargate"" franchise: Stargate Origins (2018).","1968-09-04",,2,,2023611,,"Acting","Aylam Orian","Cleveland - Ohio - USA",0.6,"/7OK2pIpslIiZ482mL1xhvu7Igtk.jpg",,,

In his movies, he is known for his acrobatic fighting style, comic timing, use of improvised weapons, and innovative stunts. Jackie Chan has been acting since the 1970s and has appeared in over 100 films.

Chan has received stars on the Hong Kong Avenue of Stars and the Hollywood Walk of Fame. As a cultural icon, Chan has been referenced in various pop songs, cartoons, and video games. Chan is also a Cantopop and Mandopop star, having released a number of albums and sung many of the theme songs for the films in which he has starred.

Chan was born on April 7, 1954, in Victoria Peak, in the former Crown colony of Hong Kong, as Chan Kong-sang (meaning ""born in Hong Kong"") to Charles and Lee-Lee Chan, refugees from the Chinese Civil War. He was nicknamed Paopao (Chinese: 炮炮, literally meaning ""Cannonball"") because he was such a big baby, weighing 12 pounds, or about 5.4 kgs. Since his parents worked for the French Consul to Hong Kong, Chan spent his formative years within the grounds of the consul's residence in the Victoria Peak district. Chan attended the Nah-Hwa Primary School on Hong Kong Island, where he failed his first year, after which his parents withdrew him from the school.

In 1960, his father immigrated to Canberra, Australia, to work as the head cook for the American embassy, and Chan was sent to the China Drama Academy, a Peking Opera School run by Master Yu Jim-yuen. Chan trained rigorously for the next decade, excelling in martial arts and acrobatics. He eventually became part of the Seven Little Fortunes, a performance group made up of the school's best students, gaining the stage name Yuen Lo in homage to his master. Chan became close friends with fellow group members Sammo Hung and Yuen Biao, the three of them later to be known as the Three Brothers or Three Dragons. At the age of 17, he worked as a stuntman in the Bruce Lee films Fist of Fury and Enter the Dragon under the stage name Chan Yuen Lung. He received his first starring role later that year, in Little Tiger of Canton, which had a limited release in Hong Kong in 1973.","1954-04-07",,2,"http://jackiechan.com",18897,"nm0000329","Acting","Jackie Chan","Victoria Peak, Hong Kong",63.109,"/nraZoTzwJQPHspAVsKfgl3RXKKa.jpg",,,

Fealy appeared in her first silent film in 1911 for Thanhouser Studios, making another eighteen between then and 1917, after which she did not perform in film for another fourteen years. During the summers of 1912 and 1913, she organized and starred with the Fealy-Durkin Company that put on performances at the Casino Theatre at Lakeside Amusement Park in Denver and the following year began touring the western half of the U.S.

Fealy had some commercial success as a playwright-performer. She co-wrote The Red Cap with Grant Stewart, a noted New York playwright and performer, which ran at the National Theatre in Chicago in August 1928.

By the 1930s, she was living in Los Angeles where she became involved in the Federal Theatre Project and at age 50 returned to secondary roles in film, including an uncredited appearance in The Ten Commandments. Later in her career, she wrote and appeared in pageants, programs, and presented lectures for schools and community organizations.","1883-03-04","1971-11-09",1,,1467861,"nm0269863","Acting","Maude Fealy","Memphis, Tennessee, USA",8.473,"/2RF04dS7gEaiKBc8HiVvyISh8n3.jpg",,,

Joan Woodbury (December 17, 1915 – February 22, 1989) was an American actress beginning in the 1930s and continuing well into the 1960s.

Woodbury received her first acting role in the 1934 film Eight Girls in a Boat, which was uncredited. Another uncredited role followed, with her first credited role being in the 1934 film One Exciting Adventure, which starred Binnie Barnes. Her first major role, billed as Nana Martinez, was in a Hopalong Cassidy movie The Eagle's Brood. Woodbury appeared in 15 films from 1934 through 1935, of which 10 were uncredited.

In 1936, her career began to become more successful, with appearances in eight films that year, of which five were uncredited. However, of the three roles that were credited, Woodbury made an impact, and caught the attention of studios. Her mixture of Danish, British, and Native American heritage gave her an exotic appearance, and allowed her to be cast in many different ethnicities, from Hispanic to French and Asian. By 1937, her career had taken off, mostly in B-movies such as Living on Love and Bulldog Courage, but also with her receiving many credited roles.

In 1937, Woodbury starred in her first of several credited Charlie Chan films, titled Charlie Chan on Broadway. She also began appearing in numerous Westerns, portraying the heroine opposite some of the 1930s' biggest cowboy actors, to include William Boyd of Hopalong Cassidy fame, Roy Rogers, and Johnny Mack Brown. Woodbury appeared in 50 films from 1937 to 1945, almost all of which were credited. Her most memorable of that period was her lead role in the serial Brenda Starr, Reporter, in 1945.

In recent years, she has become known for her recurring role on Law & Order: Special Victims Unit as Judge Lena Petrovsky.

Joann Ratner, who later took her mother's maiden name, was born in Chicago, Illinois, to Toni Merlin and Harry Ratner, a Jewish grocer. Her family also included her older sister Harriet Glickman (1926-2020) who would go on to gain recognition for having helped persuade Charles Schulz to add a black character to his Peanuts strip.

Merlin made her first screen appearance in Cecil B. DeMille's film The Ten Commandments in 1956. Five years later, she made her Broadway debut in Becket before playing Tzeitel in Harold Prince's production of Fiddler on the Roof.

Company was the first musical for which Merlin served as the casting director. She was also in charge of casting for such plays as Follies, Evita and Sweeney Todd.

In 1986, she served as casting director for the John Carpenter film, Big Trouble in Little China.

After making appearances in several feature films, including the movie Fame, in which she played Miss Olivia Berg, a classical dance teacher; Merlin appeared in the NBC crime drama Law & Order in 1992 as a defense attorney. Like many actors from that show, she went on to play other characters in the Law & Order franchise - another defense attorney in the original show and a more recurring role as Judge Lena Petrovsky, a judge who was very stern, by-the-book, and has scolded or sanctioned, at various times, ADAs Casey Novak (Diane Neal) and Alexandra Cabot (Stephanie March) and Detective (now Lieutenant) Olivia Benson (Mariska Hargitay), in its first spin-off Law & Order: Special Victims Unit. In the latter role, she appeared in every season between the years 2000 and 2011.

In 2001, Joanna Merlin wrote Auditioning: An Actor-Friendly Guide and in 2007, shared her knowledge of the theatre industry in the instructional video Master Classes in the Michael Chekhov Technique. She teaches in New York University's graduate acting program at the Tisch School of the Arts and in 1999, founded the Michael Chekhov Association where she teaches acting workshops.

He was born into a prominent theatrical family on October 26,  1875 in London. His father was Charles Warner, and his grandfather was  James Warner, both prominent English actors. He replaced J.B. Warner as Jesus in The King of Kings  (1927) when J.B. died of tuberculosis at age 29. (J.B. was not Henry's  brother. J.B. had taken the professional last name ""Warner"" because  Henry's family took him in.)

Henry Warner's family wanted him to  become a doctor, and he graduated from London University but eventually  gave up his medical studies. The theater was in his blood, and he  studied acting in Paris and Italy before joining his father's stock  company, making his debut in the English production of ""Drink."" It was  from his father that he honed his craft.

Warner made it to  America in the early 1900s, after touring the British Empire. Billed as  Harry Warner, he made his Broadway debut in the American colonial drama  ""Audrey"" at Hoyt's Theatre on November 24, 1902, starring James O'Neill, the father of playwright Eugene O'Neill.  He was billed as H.B. Warner in his next appearance on Broadway, in the  1906 comedy ""Nurse Marjorie."" He appeared in 13 more Broadway  productions in his career, from the twin-bill of ""Susan in Search of a  Husband"" & ""A Tenement Tragedy"" (also 1906) to ""Silence"" in 1925.

He moved into motion pictures, making his debut in the Mutual short Harp of Tara (1914). Also in 1914, he appeared in a film written by Cecil B. DeMille for Famous Players Lasky, The Ghost Breaker  (1914), in which he had played on Broadway the year before. Warner  became a leading man and a star in silent pictures, reaching the zenith  of his career playing Jesus in DeMille's The King of Kings  (1927). His excellent performance was actually enhanced by the silent  screen, allowing the audience to imagine how Jesus would sound. Warner  could be extremely moving in silent pictures, notably in the melodrama Sorrell and Son (1927) as a war veteran father who sacrifices all for his son.

When talkies arrived, he became a busy supporting player. A favorite of Frank Capra , appeared in Mr. Deeds Goes to Town (1936). Cast again by Capra, he was nominated for Best Supporting Actor in Lost Horizon (1937). He also appeared in You Can't Take It with You (1938), and Mr. Smith Goes to Washington (1939). Other major talkies included The Devil and Daniel Webster (1941) and Topper Returns (1941). Other than Jesus, the role he is best remembered role for today is in It's a Wonderful Life  (1946), in which he played Mr. Gower, the druggist who is saved from  committing a lethal medication error by the young George Bailey (the James Stewart character as a child). H.B. Warner appeared in Sunset Blvd. (1950) as himself. His last credited role was as Amminadab in DeMille's The Ten Commandments (1956), a remake of the earlier silent The Ten Commandments (1923).

Eduard Franz (born Eduard Franz Schmidt; October 31, 1902 – February 10, 1987) was an American actor of theatre, film and television. Franz portrayed King Ahab in the 1953 biblical low-budget film Sins of Jezebel, Jethro in Cecil B. DeMille's The Ten Commandments (1956), and Jehoam in Henry Koster's The Story of Ruth (1960).  By 1936, Franz was a player on the national stage, performing from coast to coast. He became a leading Broadway actor for nearly 30 years, in such plays as First Stop to Heaven and Embezzled Heaven and Conversation At Midnight. He made his film debut in a bit part, in 1947, in Killer at Large, but followed that brief appearance the next year with a memorable role in the motion picture The Scar (also titled Hollow Triumph). His fourth movie saw him acting with John Wayne in Wake of the Red Witch, in 1948. He portrayed Chief Broken Hand in White Feather. He played such intellectuals as Dr. Stern in The Thing from Another World (1951), a university professor in The Four Skulls of Jonathan Drake (1959), and Justice Louis Brandeis in The Magnificent Yankee (1950), a role he reprised in the 1965 television adaptation. He appeared in a 1957 television adaptation of A. J. Cronin's novel Beyond This Place, which was directed by Sidney Lumet.

Franz performed as well in two separate remakes of Al Jolson's 1927 cinema classic The Jazz Singer, each time playing the key role of the aged and ailing synagogue cantor upset by his son's decision to pursue a secular show-business career rather than continue the family tradition and follow in his father's religious footsteps. Those remakes were the 1952 film version of the story starring Danny Thomas and the 1959 television version starring Jerry Lewis.

Franz performed in a number of television series, including Gunsmoke; Have Gun - Will Travel; The Law and Mr. Jones; The Barbara Stanwyck Show and Cimarron City.  Franz was cast as psychiatric clinic director Dr. Edward Raymer in 30 episodes of the weekly ABC medical drama Breaking Point","1902-10-31","1983-02-10",2,,94070,"nm0291829","Acting","Eduard Franz","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA",2.599,"/8goRvysRqF7r55ufcc5U6sPndsN.jpg",,,

Born in New York in 1910, DeKova gave up teaching for the stage, and played in many Shakespearean productions before getting work on Broadway. One of his first starring roles was in the classic detective play ""Detective Story"", which got him noticed and brought to Hollywood. He debuted in Viva Zapata! (1952) as the devious Mexican colonel who sets up Zapata's assassination. For the next several years he played an assortment of gangsters, killers, gunfighters and Indians--with time out to play a prehistoric patriarch in Roger Corman's campy Teenage Cave Man (1958)--and did much television work, including a standout job as a Mafia hit-man assigned to kill Elliot Ness in Westinghouse Desilu Playhouse: The Untouchables: Part 1 (1959).

Douglass Rupert Dumbrille (October 13, 1889 – April 2, 1974) was a Canadian actor and one of the Canadian pioneers in early Hollywood.

In 1913, the East Coast film industry was flourishing and that year he appeared in the film What Eighty Million Women Want, but it would be another 11 years before he appeared on screen again.

In 1924, he made his Broadway debut and worked off and on in the theatre for several years while supplementing his income by selling such products as car accessories, tea, insurance, real estate, and books.

During the Great Depression, Dumbrille moved to the West Coast of the U.S., where he specialized in playing secondary character roles alongside the great stars of the day. His physical appearance and suave voice equipped him for roles as slick politician, corrupt businessman, crooked sheriff, or unscrupulous lawyer.

He was highly regarded by the studios and was sought out by Cecil B. DeMille, Frank Capra, Hal Roach and other prominent Hollywood filmmakers. A friend of fellow Canadian-born director Allan Dwan, Dumbrille played Athos in Dwan’s 1939 adaptation of The Three Musketeers.

Dumbrille had roles in more than 200 motion pictures and, with the advent of television, made numerous appearances in the 1950s and 1960s. He had the ability to project a balance of menace and pomposity in roles as the ""heavy"" in comedy films, such as those of the Marx Brothers or Abbott and Costello.","1889-10-13","1974-04-02",2,,34748,"nm0241523","Acting","Douglass Dumbrille","Hamilton, Ontario, Canada",2.658,"/bxsogl0UHKC4SS7yDsBXWiywfQl.jpg",,,

By 1936, Carradine had become a member of John Ford's stock company and appeared in The Prisoner of Shark Island. In total, he made 11 pictures with Ford, including The Grapes of Wrath. Other Ford films in which Carradine appeared include The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance and Stagecoach.  Carradine claimed to have appeared in more than 450 movies, but only 225 movies can be documented. His count is closer to fact if theatrical movies, made-for-TV movies, and television programs are included. He often played eccentric, insane, or diabolical characters, especially in the horror genre with which he had become identified. He occasionally played a heroic role as in The Grapes of Wrath and he occasionally played a sympathetic role as in Son of Fury: The Story of Benjamin Blake.

He was married four times, had five children, and was the patriarch of the Carradine acting family, which includes his sons Bruce Carradine, David Carradine,  Keith Carradine and Robert Carradine as well as his granddaughters Martha Plimpton, Sorel Carradine and Ever Carradine.","1906-02-05","1988-11-27",2,,8516,"nm0001017","Acting","John Carradine","New York City, New York, USA",18.085,"/hv2AAXNlTHVmGgXn8q7025S0g2b.jpg",,,

She began her acting career in Australia before moving to New York in 1918. There she established herself as one of the greatest theatrical actresses and was a major star on Broadway throughout the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s. Her notable stage works included the role of Lady Macbeth, which she played first in the 1920s, and gave an Emmy Award-winning television performance in Macbeth (1960). Anderson's long association with Euripides's ""Medea"" began with her acclaimed Tony Award-winning 1948 stage performance in the title role. She appeared in the television version of Medea (1983) in the supporting character of the Nurse.

Anderson made her Hollywood film debut under director Rowland Brown in a supporting role in Blood Money (1933). Her striking, not conventionally attractive features were complemented with her powerful presence, mastery of timing and an effortless style. Anderson made a film career as a supporting character actress in several significant films including Alfred Hitchcock's Rebecca (1940), for which she was Oscar nominated for Best Supporting Actress. She worked with director Otto Preminger in Laura (1944), then with René Clair in And Then There Were None (1945). Her remarkable performance in a supporting role in Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (1958) fit in a stellar acting ensemble under director Richard Brooks.

Anderson was awarded Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1960 Queen's New Year's Honours List for her services to the performing arts. Living in Santa Barbara in her later years, she also had a successful stint on the soap opera Santa Barbara (1984) and was nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award in 1984.

He made his feature film debut in Short Term 12 (2013), for which he was nominated for an Independent Spirit Award. In 2014, he co-starred in the horror film The Purge: Anarchy and in the Martin Luther King biopic Selma, as civil rights activist Jimmie Lee Jackson. Stanfield appeared in the film Dope (2015). He played rapper Snoop Dogg in the biopic about the hip-hop group N.W.A, Straight Outta Compton (2015), and will appear in the upcoming Oliver Stone biopic Snowden (2015).

Stanfield was born in San Bernardino, California, and grew up in Riverside and Victorville, California. He has said that he ""grew up very poor in a fractured family that was dysfunctional on both sides"". He decided to become an actor when he was 14 years old when he joined his high school's drama club. He attended the John Casablancas Modeling and Career Center in Los Angeles, where he was signed by an agency manager and began to audition for commercials.

Stanfield's first role was in the short film Short Term 12 (2009), which was filmmaker Destin Daniel Cretton's thesis project at San Diego State University, and won the Jury Award for U.S. Short Filmmaking at the 2009 Sundance Film Festival. A year later, he appeared in the short film Gimme Grace (2010), before he gave up acting for several years. He went on to work a number of different jobs—roof work, gardening, at AT&T, and at a legal marijuana factory—before he was contacted by Cretton to reappear in a feature-length adaptation of Short Term 12, his first feature film. For the duration of the film's production, Stanfield practiced method acting, distancing himself from the other cast members like his character, Marcus. He was the only actor to appear in both the short and feature films.

Short Term 12 won the Grand Jury Prize for Best Narrative Feature at the 2013 South by Southwest film festival, and Stanfield was nominated for the Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Male. The film featured ""Vicious"", a rap song co-written with Milgaten, and ""So You Know What It's Like"", a rap song co-written with Cretton, which a number of Oscar pundits predicted would be nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song, although it did not ultimately receive a nomination.

In 2014, Stanfield co-starred in The Purge: Anarchy and Selma, in the latter playing civil rights activist Jimmie Lee Jackson. He is set to appear in James Franco's upcoming film Memoria and in Don Cheadle's Miles Ahead. Stanfield will also star in the fantasy horror thriller film King Ripple, by the Michigan filmmaker Luke Jaden, and the music video for the Run the Jewels song ""Close Your Eyes (And Count to Fuck)"". In 2015, he portrayed rapper Snoop Dogg in the biopic Straight Outta Compton.

Born in Belfort, France, his family is originally from the region of Oran, Algeria. He is most notably known for his starring role as Malik El Djebena in the 2009 award-winning French movie A Prophet by Jacques Audiard.

Rahim has demonstrated multilingual skills and an ear for accents, having played in Corsican and Arabic in addition to French in A Prophet, and in ancient Gaelic for his role as the seal prince in Kevin Macdonald's The Eagle.

He says that he found refuge from the boredom of Belfort in cinema. Watching up to five movies a week during his youth, this habit that gave birth and fed his passion for the art.

After earning a Baccalauréat at the Lycée Condorcet of Belfort, he enrolled first in Sports and then Computer Science programs. After two subsequent years of an unmotivated boredom with the subjects in Strasbourg and Marseille, Rahim decided to pursue his passion and began to study film at the Paul Valéry University of Montpellier. His life as a film student was chronicled in a documentary by Cyril Mennegun titled ""Tahar, student"", aired on French TV channel France 5 in 2006.

Following this, Rahim moved to Paris in 2005 and studied drama at the Laboratoire de l'Acteur under Hélène Zidi-Chéruy while working in a factory during the week, and in a night club on weekends to make ends meet.

In mid 2006, after signing with an agent, Rahim won a part in the hit Canal+ television series La Commune written by Abdel Raouf Dafri. Dafri penned the first draft of the script to A Prophet. Rahim then met Audiard when the two coincidentally shared a cab while the two were leaving a set. Tahar introduced himself saying that ""I knew it was Audiard and I said I was a fan but I think I was a bit silly"" and was afterward very surprised that Audiard remembered him enough to contact him about A Prophet. After a two-line appearance in 2008 horror movie Inside starring Béatrice Dalle, he went through a gruelling three months of auditioning. After eight callbacks, he landed his breakthrough role.

Rahim is now set to star in controversial Chinese director Lou Ye's movie Bitch. The director, twice banned from making movies by the Chinese government, likely met Tahar at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival where they were each presenting Spring Fever and A Prophet respectively. Bitch is the adaptation of the banned biography of Jie Liu Falin.

Ashanti Shequoiya Douglas born October 13, 1980 is an American recording artist, record producer and actress who rose to fame in the early 2000s. Ashanti is most famous for her eponymous debut album, which featured the hit song ""Foolish"", and sold over 503,000 copies in its first week of release throughout the U.S. in April 2002. The album set a Soundscan record as the biggest opening week sales for a new female artist, outselling debuts by Alicia Keys and Lauryn Hill. In the same week, she became the first female performer to simultaneously hold the top two places on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart with ""Foolish"", and ""What's Luv?"" (with Fat Joe). Ashanti broke records again by having three top ten songs, ""Foolish,"" ""What's Luv?"" and ""Always on Time"", on the Billboard Hot 100 charts in the same week, being the first woman to accomplish this feat and being second only to the Beatles. In 2003, the self-titled debut album won Ashanti her first Grammy Award for Best Contemporary R&B album. As of 2008, she has sold more than 27 million albums worldwide. Ashanti ended the decade (2000–09) as the third top new R&B artist behind Alicia Keys and Beyonce Knowles. She also ended the decade at number 38 on the Top Artist of the Decade list. As of 2010, Ashanti is listed in the 20 Best Selling Music Singles Since 1990 in History. She ranked #17, with Foolish selling more than 7.4 million copies in the U.S.

Ashanti sang background vocals for Jennifer Lopez on ""I'm Real (Murder Remix)"" and wrote and sang background on the song ""Ain't It Funny (Murder Remix)"" sung by Jennifer Lopez, both reaching number one on Billboard Hot 100 , which was also in the top 10 charts at the same time as ""Foolish"", ""Always on Time"" (with Ja Rule), and ""What's Luv"" (with Fat Joe). Later that year, she was acclaimed as the ""Princess Of Hip-Hop & R&B"" by her label and capped off her successful debut by winning eight Billboard awards and two American Music Awards. Within seven years of Ashanti's career, she has scored 16 top 40 hits on the Hot 100. Ashanti has endorsed numerous products including Gap, Herbal Essences and Mudd Jeans.

Ashanti cites Janet Jackson, Prince, Madonna, Tupac Shakur, Aaliyah, Tamia, Mary J. Blige, Ella Fitzgerald, Peggy Lee, Yolanda Adams, Toni Braxton, Luther Vandross, The Beatles, The Clark Sisters, Smokey Robinson, Donna Summer, and Blue Magic as her musical influences. Praised as a gifted songwriter by her peers and critics alike, Ashanti has written/co-written the bulk of all her music. She is currently working on her own publishing company entitled Written Entertainment. She released her fourth studio album entitled The Declaration on June 3, 2008 and is currently in the studio working on her fifth. She also performed the charity tune ""Just Stand Up"" alongside 14 other female singers for the ""Stand Up to Cancer"" live television special which helped raise $100 million dollars for cancer research

false,"[""Adoni Maropakis""]","Born and raised in Burgettstown, Pennsylvania, a small town near Pittsburgh. He is the middle son of Petro and Despina Maropis and is very close to his brothers, Sam and Chris.

Being an exceptional all-around athlete in high school (Burgettstown High-school in southwest Pennsylvania), it appeared Adoni would pursue a professional career in some sport. Turning down various athletic scholarships, he enrolled at West Virginia University and graduated magna cum laude with a Bachelor's Degree in Business Administration.

But, from years of being entertained by Adoni's impromptu comedic performances and impersonations which began when he was a small child, his father, Petro, told him that the suit and tie of the business world would probably choke him to death and encouraged Adoni to give acting a shot. Surprised, yet intrigued at this suggestion, Adoni enrolled at a performing arts school, Point Park College (now a University) in Pittsburgh, and studied acting, dialects, singing, and a bit of dance.

His first stage role was as a freshman, even though freshman weren't allowed to perform at the time, where they needed him as an ""Arabian Carrier"" in The Nutcracker Sweet. Not only did Adoni get to flex his muscles in that role, but he also played the ""Jack-in-the-Box"" in the same production. Some of his other memorable plays and musicals were: Working, Evita, Getting Out, You Can't Take it With You, and Little Shop of Horrors where he played the man-eating plant, ""Audrey II."" After three years of theatre at Point Park, with the help of his younger brother Chris, he headed for Hollywood.

Although Adoni is truly blessed with a more than usual dose of athletic ability and creative talent, what truly makes Adoni stand out is that he is a Type 1 Diabetic, and has been since he was 18 months old. His parents were told he would be weak and sickly, and in and out of hospitals his whole life. Ultimately, a renowned diabetic specialist told his father that most likely Adoni would be dead by the age of 25. As Adoni puts it, ""I get a kick out of someone saying I can't do it."" This has been proven by his numerous athletic awards and championships throughout high-school and college which involved everything - strength, speed, quickness and finesse. The list includes: tennis, basketball, baseball, football, weightlifting, arm-wrestling, fitness, and his favorite pastime, which is table tennis (ping-pong). Adoni loves being creative with his workouts which involve only 30-45 minutes per day of either running, biking, aerobics, some martial arts, or what he calls his ""unique, unnatural, yet truly natural Cirque du Soleil/Tarzan workout"".

Some of Adoni's diverse and memorable roles include: the flamboyant evil sorcerer, Quan Chi, in the TV show ""Mortal Kombat: Conquest"" (1998), the sarcastic undercover agent in The Gristle (2001), ""Abu-Fayed,"" in Season 6 of the Fox hit series ""24"" (2001) and the regal falcon-man in Hidalgo (2004), starring Viggo Mortensen. An inspiration to the world, Adoni will tell you that the most important ingredients to success and happiness are - love, laughter, and fitness! He credits his family and a few good friends with supplying all three.","1963-01-01",,2,"https://www.adoni-maropis.com/",20808,"nm0549538","Acting","Adoni Maropis","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA",0.84,"/eMT9AihEqmnJdAqIqWvsWm590mn.jpg",,,

false,"[""Eric Banadinovich"",""Эрик Бана"",""Έρικ Μπάνα"",""에릭 바나""]","Eric Bana is an Australian film and television actor. He began his career as a comedian in the sketch comedy series Full Frontal before gaining critical recognition in the biopic Chopper (2000). After a decade of roles in Australian TV shows and films, Bana gained Hollywood's attention by playing the role of American Delta Force Sergeant Norm ""Hoot"" Hooten in Black Hawk Down (2001), the lead role as Bruce Banner in the Ang Lee directed film Hulk (2003), Prince Hector in the movie Troy (2004), the lead in Steven Spielberg's Munich (2005), and the villain Nero in the science-fiction film Star Trek (2009).

An accomplished dramatic actor and comedian, he received Australia's highest film and television awards for his performances in Chopper, Full Frontal and Romulus, My Father. Bana performs predominantly in leading roles in a variety of low-budget and major studio films, ranging from romantic comedies and drama to science fiction and action thrillers.

Eric Bana was the younger of two children; he has a brother, Anthony. He is of Croatian ancestry on his father's side. Bana's paternal grandfather, Mate Banadinović, fled to Argentina after the Second World War, and Bana's paternal grandmother emigrated to Germany and then to Australia in the 1950s with her son, Ivan (Bana's father). His father was a logistics manager for Caterpillar, Inc., and his German-born mother, Eleanor, was a hairdresser. Bana grew up in Melbourne's Tullamarine, a suburban area on the western edge of the city, near the main airport. In a cover story for The Mail on Sunday, he told author Antonella Gambotto-Burke that his family had suffered from racist taunts, and that it had distressed him. ""Wog is such a terrible word,"" he said. He has stated: ""I have always been proud of my origin, which had a big influence on my upbringing. I have always been in the company of people of European origin"".

Showing acting skill early in life, Bana began doing impressions of family members at the age of six or seven, first mimicking his grandfather's walk, voice and mannerisms. In school, he mimicked his teachers as a means to get out of trouble. As a teen, he watched the Mel Gibson film Mad Max (1979), and decided he wanted to become an actor. However, he did not seriously consider a career in the performing arts until 1991 when he was persuaded to try stand-up comedy while working as a barman at Melbourne's Castle Hotel. His stand-up gigs in inner-city pubs did not provide him with enough income to support himself, so he continued his work as a barman and bussing tables.","1968-08-09",,2,,8783,"nm0051509","Acting","Eric Bana","Melbourne, Australia",26.333,"/xIjQVywxkymHbbSO7lD2F9f377W.jpg",,,

false,"[]","Born in Anchorage, Alaska, Keith grew up loving the outdoors, skiing, fishing, and camping until his parents returned to their roots in the Amish country of Western Pennsylvania. It was here, during his teenage years that he discovered music, acting and theatre. He received a bachelors degree in music education/trumpet from Clarion University and then spent the next three years as a high school band director in Northwestern Pa. From there, he moved to South Florida to work on a masters degree from the University of Miami in theatre/voice. After graduating, New York became his home as he pursued his love affair with story telling and performance.

Within three years, he was co-starring with Tammy Grimes, Off-Broadway in ""Mademoiselle Colombe"", when Harold Prince saw his work and invited him to join the Broadway company of ""Phantom Of The Opera"". Since then he has starred in Broadway productions working with Stephen Sondheim and John Doyle, regional theatre, opera, and an appearance at the White House for President George H. Bush. Symphonic concerts have taken him all over the world with Skitch Henderson and Peter Nero.

Early television appearances lead to more definitive work in film and episodic television, including ""The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel"", ""Royal Pains"" and ""Sex&Drugs&Rock&Roll"". Recent film work includes ""Joker"", ""Red"", ""Diving Normal"", and ""Crime Partners"".

As a writer, his screen play ""Conduit"" finds the most cynical woman on earth traveling through time to alter the events of 33 AD. Outrageous exploits and shocking discoveries force her to confront personal demons or risk a cataclysmic change of history.

Keith continues to make the New York area a home for his family, and when he's not busy on set or in the theatre, he spends much of his time pursing his love for flying. As a single engine pilot, his perfect weekend is a flight to some location where he can return to the outdoors, golfing, scuba diving, skiing, camping or fishing.

She shared most of her scenes with Tom Cruise, who played a foul-mouthed sex guru, and the subject of her interview.

Johnson is half-Black and half-Samoan. His father, Rocky Johnson, is a Black Canadian, from Nova Scotia, and part of the first Black tag team champions in WWE history back when it was known as the WWF along with Tony Atlas. His mother is Samoan and the daughter of Peter Maivia, who was also a pro wrestler. Maivia's wife, Lia Maivia, was one of wrestling's few female promoters, taking over Polynesian Pacific Pro Wrestling after her husband's death in 1982, until 1988. Through his mother, he is considered a non-blood relative of the Anoa'i wrestling family. On March 29, 2008, The Rock inducted his father and his grandfather into the WWE Hall of Fame.

As of 2014, Johnson has a home in Southwest Ranches, Florida as well as Los Angeles, California. He also owns a farm in Virginia. In 2009, Johnson gained citizenship in Canada in honor of his father's background. Though Johnson was previously registered as a Republican, he voted for Barack Obama in the 2008 and 2012 United States presidential elections and is now an independent voter. He stated he did not vote in the 2016 U.S. election.

In recognition of his service to the Samoan people, and because he is a descendant of Samoan chiefs, Johnson had the noble title of Seiuli bestowed upon him by Malietoa Tanumafili II during his visit there in July 2004. He received a partial Samoan pe'a tattoo on his left side in 2003,and, in 2017, had the small ""Brahma bull"" tattoo on his right arm covered with a larger half-sleeve tattoo of a bull's skull.

Johnson married Dany Garcia on May 3, 1997. Their only child together, a daughter named Simone, was born in August 2001. On June 1, 2007, they announced they were splitting up amicably. Johnson then began dating Lauren Hashian, daughter of Boston drummer Sib Hashian. They first met in 2006 while Johnson was filming The Game Plan. Their first child together, a daughter, was born in December 2015. Their second child, another daughter, was born in April 2018.

Johnson attended the 2000 Democratic National Convention as part of WWE's non-partisan ""Smackdown Your Vote"" campaign, which aimed to influence young people to vote. He also had a speaking role at the 2000 Republican National Convention that same year.

In 2006, Johnson founded the Dwayne Johnson Rock Foundation, a charity working with at-risk and terminally ill children. On October 2, 2007, he and his ex-wife donated $1 million to the University of Miami to support the renovation of its football facilities; it was noted as the largest donation ever given to the university's athletics department by former students. The University of Miami renamed the Hurricanes' locker room in Johnson's honor. In 2015, Johnson donated $1,500 to a GoFundMe to pay for an abandoned dog's surgery. In 2017, he donated $25,000 to Hurricane Harvey relief efforts. In 2018, Johnson donated a gym to a military base in Oahu, Hawaii.

Classically trained, Dana has also played roles in plays from Shakespeare to Oscar Wilde, and has appeared in numerous movies and daytime and primetime TV shows. You may have seen her in Manifest and John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum.

Dana began her acting education in the best way possible, on a scholarship with the world-renowned Lee Strasberg Film & Theatrical Institute at just 13 years of age. She blossomed into a talented performer right before Hollywood's finest, as acting greats Robert De Nero and Al Pacino would stop by to catch a glimpse of the next generation of talent.

Later, Dana continued to build on her craft by training with the great teachers of her profession in Howard Fine, Ivanna Chubbuck, and Margie Haber.

While acting remains her no. 1 passion, Dana's resume also features several stunt performances on productions such as 2001's Planet of the Apes and 2014's Swelter.

Dana's artistic ambitions revealed themselves at an early age. At just seven years old, she expressed her creative talents through music, when impressing her friends and family with her violin and flute performances. However, it wasn't until she joined a performing art school at 13 that her acting and dance talents emerged, and a future star was born.

Thanks to her perceived good looks, Dana's earlier years saw her became a high-fashion and runway model, with her resume including a photo shoot with the esteemed David LaChapelle. So while she can kick ass, don't worry...you can be damn sure she's going to look good doing it.

When Dana commits to a project, she really commits. Make no mistake...she's in this business for the long haul. That focus and discipline may have something to do with the fact that her paternal roots lie in the military. The German blood she inherited from her father's side may help with that too.

Dana even manages to find a little time for herself on occasion. When she does, she enjoys reading, photography, learning, traveling, and getting lost on the Internet.

Dana looks forward to fulfilling her EGOT ambitions, performing alongside the likes of Glenn Close and Johnny Depp along the way.",,,1,"http://www.danaschick.com",1950920,"nm3137314","Acting","Dana Schick"," Munich, Bavaria, Germany",1.96,"/8PnlNY6aAmx9nA3j0VZXNN34W1t.jpg",,,

He is most known for his roles in urban westerns and action pictures. He was the brother of actor Fernando Almada.

Almada was born in Huatabampo, Sonora. Apart from acting he was also a director, writer and film producer. He began his artistic career in Mexico during the 1930s. He has appeared in over 200 films, with his first being Madre Querida in 1935. In this film he acted alongside his brother Fernando as children as an extra. He would not appear in another film again until a few decades later.

Almada moved from his home city of Huatabampo to Ciudad Obregón and to Guadalajara, Jalisco, where he lived for many years until he settled down in Mexico City. Almada was born to a family connected to the film industry, and was exposed to film shootings from an early age and, when he moved to Mexico City, he began working at a nightclub called Cabaret Master that was owned by his father.

When his brother Fernando decided to take up acting, Mario decided to become a film producer. He wrote his first film script in 1963. The Almada brothers had their own family-run production company that eventually dissolved due to financial troubles from lack of profit.

Almada died in his sleep at the age of 94 on October 4, 2016.

false,"[""William Albert Walters""]","Born in Columbus, Ohio in 1937, Bill attended Grandview Heights High  School and the Ohio State University where he majored in fine arts  hoping to get into advertising or cartooning. Among his many mementos  are a sheaf of rejection slips from The New Yorker and Playboy. He was  introduced to the theatre by volunteering to design the set for a  friend's student production. He worked on the art staff of the OSU  Motion Pictures Department and the University TV station, WOSU. In 1963,  after the usual summer stock assignments, he arrived in New York City,  where he worked at NBC as a page and as a production assistant. He  became a backstage jack-of-all-trades with The New York Shakespeare  Festival, The Playhouse of the Ridiculous, and many other regional and  off-Broadway theater groups.

In 1966 he was hired by Peter  Schickele as the stage manager for PDQ Bach, and became known to  thousands of concert goers in New York and around the country as the  irascible and irritable but always efficient apologist for Schickele's  satiric presentations of the infamous ""Evening of Musical Madness"".  Despite his crusty on-stage persona, Bill was for 46 years the technical  coordinator, production manager, road manager, and the REAL stage  manager of the series of concerts that had its first public performance  in 1965 at Town Hall in New York. He once said that he felt like Sky  Masterson, the gambler-hero of ""Guys and Dolls"", who noted that: ""There  are two things that have been in every hotel room in America: Sky  Masterson and the Gideon Bible.""

Walters continues to work in  concerts, theatre, dabbles in background work in movies and TV, writes  lots of unproduced plays and film scripts, and teaches film-making and  video with kids. He also works for Gray Line New York Sightseeing as a  tour guide riding around on the top of a double-decker bus telling lies  about New York City to gullible and unwary tourists.

He is married to the actress Donegal Browne. Their daughter Samantha Browne-Walters is also an actress.","1937-12-11",,0,,1290726,"nm2450269","Acting","Bill Walters","Columbus, OH",0.6,"/jkkutFGkL4HPPTSRRenoRcAt4XL.jpg",,,

His father, Pelegrino Spagnuolo (b. 1892, d. 1950), died from liver and kidney disease. His mother Filomena Spagnuolo (b. 1903, d. 1987) was a bit-part actress who acted in a few movies, some of them alongside her son. Spinell stood 5 foot and 11 inches. He was born at his family's apartment in Manhattan's Little Italy on 2nd Avenue in Manhattan. A few years after the death of his father, he moved with his mother and older siblings to Woodside, Queens, New York where he lived off-and-on for the remainder of his life. Spinell suffered most of his life from hemophilia as well as chronic asthma. Because of his large, heavyset frame and imposing looks, Spinell was often cast as criminals, thugs, or corrupt police officers. His most notable roles were as mafioso Willi Cicci in The Godfather and The Godfather Part II, and as loan shark Tony Gazzo in Rocky and Rocky II. Although primarily known as a character actor, Spinell co-wrote and starred as a serial killer in the 1980 film, Maniac. Joe Spinell died in his apartment on January 13, 1989 at the age of 52. The cause of his untimely death is arguable to this day. Some say that his death was caused by sudden heart attack due to heavy drug use, drinking and emotional distress in light of his mother passing away two years earlier. It is also speculated that he may have died from asthma complications, or bled to death from hemophilia related causes. He was planning a sequel to Maniac before his death. He was buried in Calvary Cemetery, Queens near his home. He is the distant cousin of the American football team St. Louis Ram's Head Coach Steve Spagnuolo. Spinell was married to adult film star Jean Jennings from February 1977 to July 1979.

It appears in the 1977 The Godfather: A Novel for Television, which combined the first two films – The Godfather and The Godfather Part II, adding back scenes that had been previously cut and telling the story chronologically beginning with Vito Andolini's childhood in Sicily.

false,"[""Abraham Charles Vigodah""]","Tall, dour-faced and slouch-shouldered character actor Abraham Charles Vigoda (February 24, 1921 – January 26, 2016) proved himself in both gritty dramatic roles, and as an actor with wonderful comedic timing.

Vigoda was born in Brooklyn, New York, to Lena (Moses) and Samuel Vigoda, both Russian Jewish immigrants. His father was a tailor on the Lower East Side. He made his first stage appearance at the age of 17 and plodded away in small theater shows for over 20 years. For the majority of film-goers, Vigoda first came to prominence in The Godfather (1972) as the double-crossing Tessio, pleading with Robert Duvall to get him off the hook ""for old times' sake."" He also appeared in its sequel.

Vigoda had roles in a few nondescript TV films before landing the plum part of Sgt. Phil Fish on the brilliant sitcom Barney Miller (1974). Perhaps his best known role, Sgt. Fish proved popular enough to be spun off to his own (short-lived) series Fish (1977).

With his long face and unusual looks, Vigoda remained in high demand in mafioso-type roles, and for a while in the mid-1980s, he was mistakenly believed to have been dead, leading producers to remark, ""I need an Abe Vigoda type actor,"" not realizing Vigoda was still alive and well. The 1990s and beyond became busy again for him, with appearances in North (1994), The Misery Brothers (1995), A Brooklyn State of Mind (1998), and Crime Spree (2003). He continued acting into his 90s, surprising audiences with his entertaining style.

Alfred Lettieri (February 24, 1928–October 18, 1975) was an American actor, known for his portrayal of Virgil Sollozzo, in The Godfather.

Lettieri projected an aura of menace and ruthlessness in his film roles, which he attributed to his acquaintance with real-life gangsters, including Joey Gallo. At the age of 36, he made his screen debut in the television film The Hanged Man. Lettieri acted with some of Hollywood's biggest screen names including Steve McQueen in The Getaway, Charles Bronson in Mr. Majestyk, John Wayne in McQ and both Marlon Brando and Al Pacino in The Godfather.

Lettieri died of a heart attack in 1975, at the age of 47, leaving two children.

Keaton began her career on stage appearing in the original 1968 Broadway production of the musical Hair. The next year, she received a Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Play nomination for her performance in Woody Allen's comic play Play it Again, Sam. She then made her screen debut in a small role in Lovers and Other Strangers (1970). She rose to prominence with her first major film role as Kay Adams-Corleone in Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather (1972), a role she reprised in its sequels The Godfather Part II (1974) and The Godfather Part III (1990). The films that most shaped her career were those with director and co-star Woody Allen, beginning with the film adaptation of Play It Again, Sam (1972). Her next two films with Allen, Sleeper (1973) and Love and Death (1975), established her as a comic actor.

Considered one of the most influential actors of the 20th century, he received numerous accolades throughout his career which spanned six decades, including two Academy Awards, two Golden Globe Awards, and three British Academy Film Awards. Brando was also an activist for many causes, notably the civil rights movement and various Native American movements. Having studied with Stella Adler in the 1940s, he is credited with being one of the first actors to bring the Stanislavski system of acting and method acting, derived from the Stanislavski system, to mainstream audiences.

He initially gained acclaim and his first Academy Award nomination for Best Actor in a Leading Role for reprising the role of Stanley Kowalski in the 1951 film adaptation of Tennessee Williams' play A Streetcar Named Desire, a role that he originated successfully on Broadway. He received further praise, and a first Academy Award and Golden Globe Award, for his performance as Terry Malloy in On the Waterfront, and his portrayal of the rebellious motorcycle gang leader Johnny Strabler in The Wild One proved to be a lasting image in popular culture. Brando received Academy Award nominations for playing Emiliano Zapata in Viva Zapata! (1952); Mark Antony in Joseph L. Mankiewicz's 1953 film adaptation of Shakespeare's Julius Caesar; and Air Force Major Lloyd Gruver in Sayonara (1957), an adaptation of James A. Michener's 1954 novel.

The 1960s saw Brando's career take a commercial and critical downturn. He directed and starred in the cult western One-Eyed Jacks, a critical and commercial flop, after which he delivered a series of notable box-office failures, beginning with Mutiny on the Bounty (1962). After ten years of underachieving, he agreed to do a screen test as Vito Corleone in Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather (1972). He got the part and subsequently won his second Academy Award and Golden Globe Award in a performance critics consider among his greatest. He declined the Academy Award due to alleged mistreatment and misportrayal of Native Americans by Hollywood. The Godfather was one of the most commercially successful films of all time, and alongside his Oscar-nominated performance in Last Tango in Paris (1972), Brando reestablished himself in the ranks of top box-office stars.

After a hiatus in the early 1970s, Brando was generally content with being a highly paid character actor in supporting roles, such as Jor-El in Superman (1978), as Colonel Kurtz in Apocalypse Now (1979), and Adam Steiffel in The Formula (1980), before taking a nine-year break from film. According to the Guinness Book of World Records, Brando was paid a record $3.7 million ($16 million in inflation-adjusted dollars) and 11.75% of the gross profits for 13 days' work on Superman.

Brando was ranked by the American Film Institute as the fourth-greatest movie star among male movie stars whose screen debuts occurred in or before 1950. He was one of only six actors named in 1999 by Time magazine in its list of the 100 Most Important People of the Century.

false,"[]","Chris Ellis is an American film and television actor who was born April 14, 1956 in Dallas, Texas. Ellis always wanted to be an actor because of television. He grew up in the 50's in the deep south in a ""world of privation and violence"", but saw on television people who seemed to have lives of ease and privilege.

It took him seven years to finish college however, because ""I have always been shiftless"". During those years Chris became involved in community theatre in Memphis, where ""I did and do still think the quality of the work has always been quite good"". By the time he moved to New York, he had worked with many excellent actors in about two dozen plays, classical and contemporary. ""I cannot imagine what might have supplanted that background for a newcomer in New York.""

His first part in either television or film came in 1979, where he played a truck driver in the TV movie The Suicide's Wife, which starred Angie Dickinson. The role resulted in very little TV or film work. After working in regional theatre for a year or so, Chris fell off the radar screen and did not work for about ten years. During that time he lived in ""bone-grinding poverty"" in Manhattan's Hell's Kitchen. In one nine-month period of 1987, Chris accepted 102 dinner invitations. ""I don't know why they kept arriving, nor why I counted them, though I do know why I accepted them.""

In 1990, a break came when he got a part in Days of Thunder, which starred Tom Cruise, Nicole Kidman, Cary Elwes, Robert Duvall, and Randy Quaid. John C. Reilly and Fred Dalton Thompson also appear. This seemed to jump-start Ellis' career as parts in films like My Cousin Vinny with Joe Pesci and Marisa Tomei, a small part in Addams Family Values, and a larger one in Apollo 13 as former NASA Mercury Seven astronaut Deke Slayton, alongside Tom Hanks, followed. He also began picking up credits on well-known television shows like Melrose Place, NYPD Blue, and The X-Files.

Since working with Hanks on Apollo 13, the two have worked together on That Thing You Do, the TV miniseries From the Earth to the Moon, and Catch Me If You Can. Ellis returned to a fictional NASA Mission Control when he played a Flight Director in 1998's Armageddon.

Additional films in which Ellis has appeared include Home Fries, October Sky, Live Free or Die Hard, and Transformers. His television credits also include The West Wing, Ghost Whisperer, Chicago Hope, The Pretender, Alias, JAG, CSI: NY, Burn Notice, and Cold Case. He appeared in three season one episodes of Millennium as group member Jim Panseayres. He has established a reputation as being particularly talented at portraying Southern lawmakers or serious military or police-type characters.

He also appeared in Criminal Minds as Sheriff Jimmy Rhodes who calls for the BAU's help in investigating a string of murders in New Mexico. In addition to that, he also had two guest appearances in NCIS as Gunnery Sergeant John Deluca. Ellis's appearance in the Season 1 episode, ""The Curse"" was uncredited while his second and final appearance in Season 2's ""The Bone Yard"" was credited.

In 2009, he had a recurring role in the ABC Family television series Make It or Break It.

He has played two real-life astronauts, Jack Lousma in Apollo 13 (Brett is the CapCom at the time of the explosion; at that shift Lousma was the CapCom in real life) and David Scott in the HBO mini-series From the Earth to the Moon.

His most recent appearance was in the role of Barton Blaze in the movie Ghost Rider. Other movie credits include Wyatt Earp (with Kevin Costner), Gambler V: Playing for Keeps (with Kenny Rogers and Bruce Boxleitner), Something to Talk About (with Julia Roberts and Dennis Quaid), The Replacements (with Gene Hackman), On Golden Pond (with Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer), Nancy Drew, and Gridiron Gang. He also played Bob Cleary in the 1983 mini-series The Thorn Birds.

Cullen was recently cast in the up-coming femme comedy Monte Carlo alongside Selena Gomez, Andie MacDowell and Leighton Meester and is playing the role of Tom Eckert in the upcoming war film Red Dawn.

On February 8, 2011, Brett was named the official spokesman for Houston Works which helps Houston residents with job training and placement, scholarships, consulting, technical initiatives focusing on science, technology, engineering and mathematics and summer job programs along with Youth Summits.

false,"[]","Cuba Gooding was born in Bronx, New York to Shirley, a singer with the Sweethearts, and Cuba Gooding, Sr., a lead vocalist of soul group The Main Ingredient. He has two brothers, musician Tommy Gooding and fellow actor Omar Gooding, and sister, April Gooding. His family moved to Los Angeles after Gooding Sr.'s music group had a hit single with ""Everybody Plays the Fool"" in 1972 but abandoned his family two years later. Gooding Jr. was raised by his mother and attended four different high schools: North Hollywood High School, Tustin High School, Apple Valley High School, and John F. Kennedy High School in Granada Hills in Los Angeles. He served as class president in three of them.

His first job as a professional entertainer was as a break-dancer performing with singer Lionel Richie at the closing ceremonies of the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. After high school, Gooding studied Japanese martial arts for three years, before turning his focus toward acting. Early on, he landed guest starring roles on shows like Hill Street Blues (1981) and MacGyver (1985).

His first major role was in the John Singleton's box office surprise and critical hit Boyz n the Hood (1991). He followed this success with roles in major films like A Few Good Men (1992), Lightning Jack (1994), Outbreak (1995), Men of Honor (2000), Rat Race (2001), and The Fighting Temptations (2003) in which he co-starred alongside Beyoncé Knowles.

In 1996, he was cast as an arrogant football player on the brink of a career-ending injury in Cameron Crowe's Jerry Maguire (1996). The film was a success and earned him an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. His ""Show Me The Money"" line in the film became a nationwide catchphrase. In 1997, he had a notable supporting role in As Good As It Gets (1997). The next several years, his films were inconsistently successful; Boat Trip (2002), Norbit (2007), and Daddy Day Camp (2007), all of which had received extremely negative reviews and performed poorly at the box office.

Gooding also starred in a film titled A Murder of Crows, which he co-produced with his long time friend and business partner Derek Broes. The film was Gooding's first attempt at producing.  Since then, he has had series of starring roles in grittier films released direct-to-DVD such as the revenge dramas Hero Wanted and Wrong Turn at Tahoe, as well as the sci-fi action pic Hardwired and the action comedy Lies &amp; Illusions. A well-received performance as Ben Carson in Gifted Hands: The Ben Carson Story (2009) and a small supporting role in Ridley Scott's American Gangster (2007) both proved to be exceptions to this trend. An appearance in the World War II film, Red Tails, produced by George Lucas and with other prominent actors such as Terrence Howard, will mark his only return to the big screen since American Gangster.

Gooding is married to Sara Kapfer; they have two sons, Spencer and Mason.  ","1968-01-02",,2,,9777,"nm0000421","Acting","Cuba Gooding Jr.","Bronx, New York, USA",12.646,"/bxL1lZyMKcexcAKNhkU4Gy73wLb.jpg",,,

He is often noted by critics for his chameleonic performances in diverse roles and distinctive blue eyes. A native of Cork, Murphy began his performing career as a rock musician. After turning down a record deal, he made his professional acting debut in the play Disco Pigs in 1996. He went on to star in Irish and UK film and stage productions throughout the late 1990s and early 2000s, first coming to international attention in 2003 as the hero in the post-apocalyptic film 28 Days Later.

Murphy is best known for his work with director Christopher Nolan, where he appeared as the villain Jonathan Crane/Scarecrow in all three films in the Dark Knight trilogy. Murphy has also worked with Nolan on Inception and Dunkirk. In 2013, Murphy started working on a TV show for BBC titled “Peaky Blinders” as the show’s lead role, Thomas Shelby. The show is still airing as of 2020 with five highly critically acclaimed seasons under its belt A resident of London since 2001, Murphy often works in or near the city and has expressed no desire to move to Hollywood. Uncomfortable on the celebrity circuit, he customarily gives interviews about his work, but does not appear on television talk shows or discuss details of his private life with the press.

Born in Douglas and raised in Ballintemple, two suburbs of Cork, Cillian Murphy is the eldest of four children. His father, Brendan, works for the Irish Department of Education and his mother is a French teacher. Not only are his parents educators, but his aunts and uncles are also teachers, as was his grandfather. Musicianship also runs in the family, and Murphy started playing music and writing songs at age ten. In mid-2004, Murphy married his long-time live-in girlfriend, Yvonne McGuinness, an artist whom he met in 1996 at one of his rock band's shows. The couple live in northwest London with their two sons Malachy (born in 2005) and Aaron (born in 2007).

Murphy is known for being reluctant to speak about his personal life. He frequently gives interviews about his work but did not appear on a single live TV chat show, where actors customarily share information about their private lives, until 2010, when he was a guest on The Late Late Show on Ireland's RTÉ to promote Perrier's Bounty. He does not have a stylist or a personal publicist, travels without an entourage, and often attends premieres alone. Shy and private, Murphy professes a lack of interest in the celebrity scene, finding the red carpet experience ""a challenge... and not one I want to overcome."" He intentionally practices a lifestyle that will not interest the tabloids: ""I haven't created any controversy, I don't sleep around, I don't go and fall down drunk."" Murphy is friends with fellow Irish actors Colin Farrell and Liam Neeson, looking up to the latter like a ""surrogate movie dad"". But primarily, Murphy's close friendships are those he made before becoming a star.","1976-05-25",,2,,2037,"nm0614165","Acting","Cillian Murphy","Douglas, Cork, Ireland",111.422,"/i8dOTC0w6V274ev5iAAvo4Ahhpr.jpg",,,

Hall began his career in commercials and on stage as a child, and made his screen debut in 1980. His films with director-screenwriter John Hughes, beginning with the popular 1984 coming-of-age comedy Sixteen Candles, shaped his early career. Hall's next movies with Hughes were the teen classics The Breakfast Club and Weird Science, both in 1985. His performances as lovable geeks in these three films connected his name and face with the stereotype for an entire generation.

Hall diversified his roles to avoid becoming typecast as his geek persona, joining the cast of Saturday Night Live (1985–1986) and starring in films such as Out Of Bounds (1986), Johnny Be Good (1988), Edward Scissorhands (1990) and Six Degrees of Separation (1993). After a series of minor roles in the 1990s, his performance as Microsoft's Bill Gates in the 1999 film Pirates of Silicon Valley put him back in the spotlight. He had the starring role in the USA Network series The Dead Zone, from 2002 to 2007. During its run, the show was one of the highest-rated cable television series.

As an actor, his work in the film Ray earned him the Academy Award and BAFTA Award for Best Actor as well as the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a musical/comedy. He is also a Grammy Award winning musician, producing two albums which have charted highly on the Billboard 200: Unpredictable, which topped the chart, and Intuition.

Foxx was abandoned seven months after birth, and was subsequently adopted and raised in Terrell by his mother's adoptive parents, Estelle and Mark Talley. Foxx had a strict Baptist upbringing and began piano lessons at the age of five by his grandmother's orders. He has often acknowledged his grandmother's influence in his life as one of the greatest reasons for his success. When he found that female comedians were often called first to perform, he changed his name to Jamie Foxx, feeling that it was an ambiguous enough name to disallow any biases. He chose his surname as a tribute to comedian Redd Foxx.

From 1996 to 2001, Foxx starred in his own sitcom The Jamie Foxx Show, and in 1992 he made his film debut in Toys a comedy directed by Barry Levinson. Following Toys, his first dramatic role came in Oliver Stone's 1999 film Any Given Sunday, where he portrayed a hard-partying American football player. Foxx has since evolved into a respected dramatic actor. Foxx was featured as taxi driver Max Durocher in the film Collateral alongside Tom Cruise, for which he received outstanding reviews and a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. His standout performance, however, was his portrayal of Ray Charles in the biopic Ray (2004), for which he won the Academy Award for Best Actor and the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role.

While attending the University of North Carolina School of the Arts, he began training in fencing and martial arts. After graduating with a BFA in Theater, he moved to New York City where he made a name for himself as a highly sought after fight choreographer for theater, opera and ballet companies all over the United States. During this time, he got his SAG card doing stunts on a small feature film. That was when everything changed. He packed up his car and drove to Hollywood where he devoted all of his time, energy and resources in pursuit of a newly realized dream... to be a professional stuntman.

Chen was born to ethnic Chinese parents originating from China and Taiwan in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. After an education at schools in his hometown and in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, he attended college in Calgary and studied at the University of Calgary.

He currently lives in the city and periodically resides in Los Angeles in California, for additional film and television work.

Chen was cast as real-life Rolling Stone editor Ben Fong-Torres in the 2000 Cameron Crowe film, Almost Famous, and it became his breakout role. He has since appeared in Steven Spielberg's Emmy Award-winning science fiction TV miniseries Taken and in the films I, Robot, The Chronicles of Riddick, and Snakes on a Plane along with several television shows.

Chen's most recently-screened movie is a horror/thriller called They Wait, which was inspired by a real-life story. The movie casts him in the leading role alongside Jaime King as his wife, and ten year old child actor Regan Oey as their son.

Upon his arrival, all his money was stolen and he became homeless. In order to survive, he started performing on the streets of Times Square where his first day tally after performing 8-hours was a mere $4.00.

All his endurance and hard work was rewarded when Edward Zwick cast Yuki for The Last Samuri (2003). He began booking roles in such films as Drunken Sword (2005) and Roku (2005). Next Clint Eastwood cast him as Nozaki in Letters from Iwo Jima (2006). Eastwood favored Yuki for his unique preparation. In order to prepare for his role, Yuki only digested celery and water for five weeks to experience famine, confined himself inside dark closets and bathrooms to recreate the claustrophobic atmosphere for the cave fighting sequences. After Letters from Iwo Jima (2006), NBC offered Yuki a co-star role in their hit TV show Heroes (2006/II).

He also played a British aristocrat and prisoner in A Man Called Horse (1970) and a gunfighter in Clint Eastwood's Western film Unforgiven (1992).

Harris, the fifth of nine children, was born in Limerick City, County Limerick, Munster, Ireland, the son of Ivan John Harris and Mildred Josephine Harty Harris.

In 1957, he married Elizabeth Rees-Williams, the daughter of David Rees-Williams, 1st Baron Ogmore. Their three children are the actor Jared Harris, the actor Jamie Harris, and the director Damian Harris. Harris and Rees-Willams divorced in 1969, and then Elizabeth married another well-known actor, Sir Rex Harrison. Harris' second marriage was to the American actress Ann Turkel, who was 16 years younger than he, and this marriage also ended in a divorce.

Despite his divorces, Harris was a member of the Roman Catholic Knights of Malta, and was also dubbed a knight by the Queen of Denmark in 1985. Harris was a life long friend of actor Peter O'Toole. Harris died of Hodgkin's disease on 25 October 2002, aged 72, two and a half weeks before the American premiere of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. He was replaced as Dumbledore by the Irish-born actor Sir Michael Gambon. For years, whenever he was in London, Harris resided at the Savoy Hotel.

In 1987, _Everybody's All-American (1988)_ came to shoot in Baton Rouge, and Michael was chosen as Dennis Quaid stunt double for the football scenes. He caught the attention and earned the admiration of Director Taylor Hackford, who encouraged Michael to pursue a career in stunt work.

While filming Charlie's Angels (2000), Michael was kicked in the jaw with a stiletto boot. He found himself in an emergency room, insisting that he was not the victim of domestic violence. The spousal abuse representatives had a hard time believing that he had been kicked by Cameron Diaz.

Michael is most widely known as ""The Carjacker"" in Spider-Man (2002), whose actions ultimately lead Peter Parker to become Spider-Man. Michael first met director Sam Raimi when he played Kevin Costner's nemesis in For Love of the Game (1999).

The Tennessee Oilers signed him to the practice squad, then sent him to NFL Europe's Barcelona Dragons in 1998. After a season on the Oakland Raiders and Cleveland Browns' practice squads in 1999, Mustafa attended the Seattle Seahawks' training camp in 2000.

Gregory M. Brown was born in Irvington, New Jersey to Warren John Brown, a stage actor, singer, and musician who was performing at the Paper Mill Playhouse in Millburn, New Jersey and Nell Joyce (Garlick) Brown, who at the time was a housewife. His mother would eventually become the first female member of the Stock Transfer Agents Association in New York while a manager at Union Pacific Corporation. Greg is the oldest of three children. He has a sister, Suzanne Tara (Brown) Jordan and brother, David Patrick Brown.

At the age of six, his parents divorced after thirteen years of marriage. His mother, Greg and his siblings moved in with his mother's parents in Paterson, New Jersey where Greg grew up. Greg attended Eastside High School, known for the movie Lean on Me with Morgan Freeman. Greg graduated high school in 1966 and remained in Paterson until his enlistment in the U.S. Navy in November 1967. In 1968, Greg did a tour in Vietnam aboard the USS Steinaker (DD-863) a Navy destroyer and deployed on two other cruises to the Caribbean and North Atlantic respectively before being transferred to Fighter Squadron 101 at Naval Air Station Oceana in Virginia Beach, Virginia. Greg had a niche for electronics and the evolving computer industry, learning computer programming while still in the Navy. Upon separation from active duty in 1971, he started to work on Wall Street in the information technology field where he remained for the most part until his retirement as a Vice President from J.P. Morgan Chase in 2005.

As a teenager, Greg enjoyed performing in church and school plays but did not pursue the acting profession because of the divorce of his parents. His mother didn't approve, so, out of respect for his mother he waited until he was 59 years old and after his retirement from J.P. Morgan Chase and the military.

Bo is the co-author of the book “One Tough Cop”, which is a story about his life as a New York City police detective.  The movie version of “One Tough Cop” was made into a major motion picture.

Abita was born in Paris or in Aix-en-Provence on 18 March 1999. At a young age, she dreamed of becoming an actress. In 2016, when she was 17, she went to a talent manager with a friend. She met Léa Mysius who was looking for a young actress for the title role of her first feature film, Ava. Although the role is that of a 13-year-old girl, Abita was selected by the director, because her real age and physical appearance are assets for the nude scenes provided in the scenario, even if she initially refused to undress for the film before finally feeling comfortable with nudity. For her part, Abita recognized herself in the character, because of her character and her eye problems. Her performance was hailed by the press, and in November 2017 she was shortlisted for the César Award for Most Promising Actress.

After filming Ava, she followed with a supporting role in Gilles Lellouche's Le Grand Bain and then one of the main roles in Genesis by Philippe Lesage.

Wes's parents divorced when he was two and he spent most of his childhood with his Mom, sister and brother. On a whim, Wes's mother took his sister to a audition for a Tide commercial in Savannah, Georgia and brought Wes along. While waiting for his sister in the lobby, the casting director discovered Wes and at the age of five, he was offered a national campaign for Tide.  At the age of thirteen, Wes moved in with his father and without a lot of supervision and as a restless and rebellious teen, he was kicked out of high school and sent to the Gift Center in Lawrencville, GA to finish school. The Gift Center was a second chance school for troubled youth, offering very small classes and a higher standard of education than public school. While attending classes, a professional theater company out of Atlanta started a mentoring program with the school and Wes was chosen to write a play that was later performed by his classmates. It was from this experience that Wes found his passion for the arts.  After graduating high school, Wes joined the military. He worked as an aviation firefighter on the flight deck of the USS Essex, working in crash and salvage for four years. Wes' break into acting came just three months before his tour was finished when Denzel Washington chose his ship to shoot the movie Antwone Fisher. While searching for some authentic military guys for the movie, Wes was discovered by casting director Robi Reed and given his first movie making experience. That's when he decided he wanted to pursue his life long dream of acting. Following Antwone Fisher, Robi convinced Wes to make the move to Hollywood and shortly thereafter cast him in his first series regular role on Showtime's Barbershop.  Wes really started to get attention when Paul Haggis cast him along side Tommy Lee Jones as Corporal Steve Penning in In the Valley of Elah. Tommy Lee Jones was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor for his role.  In 2009, Wes would go on to work with Oliver Stone in W. as Frank Benedict, George W's Fraternity brother.

In 2012, Wes landed his first title role in Joel Silver's The Philly Kid. A fan of mixed martial arts, Wes really dived into the character of Dillion McGwire, performing all of his own stunts. The film debuted in theaters May of 2012. Following The Philly Kid, Wes starred in This Thing With Sarah, which was recently accepted to the San Diego Film Festival.  In 2013 Wes wrapped two studio films, Broken Horses and The Town That Dreaded Sundown.

He entered the industry in 1995 when he was only 2 years old. He made his drama debut in ""Good News"", which gained him immense popularity through his first full-time role as Naoya, playing the son of SMAP's Masahiro Nakai. In 2001, he was discovered by Hayao Miyazaki, and ended up voicing Bao in the animated film ""Spirited Away"" by Studio Ghibli, the highest-grossing Japanese film in Japan. From 1999 to 2002 he had appeared in over a dozen projects, earning him the title of a child prodigy. He was awarded his first award for ""Backdrop del mio Papá"" when he was only 11. From 2004 to 2020, he has won awards every one or two alternative years.

Today, Ryu remains an iconic and beloved actor in the Japanese industry. He has the reputation of a reliable lead actor who goes into character as soon as the cameras start rolling. For his successful transition from a child actor to a main lead combined with his modest personality, has made him a role model for many. When choosing works, he likes to experiment with roles or plots. He does not mind too much about popularity or being the main lead as long as he likes his role. Rather than ""aiming for a big goal ahead"", he is the type to do the job in front of him wholeheartedly.

He has appeared in numerous award-winning projects. In 2011, he won his first international award for playing the main lead in the Amade Prize–winning ""Threads of Our Hearts"". To date, he has been an integral part of all the top 4 highest-grossing Japanese movies in Japan. His works continue to break records as his movie ""your name."" became the highest-grossing Japanese movie of all time internationally.

Ryu, alongside acting and voice acting, has dabbled in multiple fields. For variety shows he often does many documentaries. He even interviewed Will Smith for the magazine TV program 'ZIP!'. In 2015, he released his first book ""Master's Café"". Ryu challenged his first stage play with ""Beautiful: The Woman Who Met with God"", directed and written by Suzuki Matsuo, in 2019. The following year, he debuted in multiple fields such as a radio DJ for 'All Night Nippon 0' (ANN0) on 11th October 2020, which airs 3 am at nights between Saturday and Sunday. His directorial debut was with the music video for ""I Treasure You"" for SUPER HANDSOME COLLECTION ""JUMP↑"". He opened his own YouTube channel. He was also the official photographer for Takeru Satoh's 2021 calendar.

In 2020, Ryu was awarded at the Elan d'or Award Ceremony, one of the most prestigious awards in Japan for completing 25 years in the industry. To thank his fans, he started the 25th Anniversary Celebration Project.","1993-05-19",,2,"https://co-lavo.co.jp/artist/ryunosuke_kamiki/",225730,"nm1126340","Acting","Ryûnosuke Kamiki","Saitama Prefecture,Japan",10.314,"/6MwcfIUraHuKOmwjT4gX8BBB2T6.jpg",,,

Global stardom followed soon after with her leading role in the epic romance Titanic (1997), which earned her a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role. Titanic was the highest-grossing film at the time, after which she eschewed parts in blockbusters in favour of critically acclaimed period pieces, including Quills (2000) and Iris (2001).

The science fiction romance Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004), in which Winslet was cast against type in a contemporary setting, proved to be a turning point in her career, and she gained further recognition for her performances in Finding Neverland (2004), Little Children (2006), Revolutionary Road (2008), and The Reader (2008).

As of 2019, his films have grossed over $7.2 billion worldwide, and he has been placed eight times in annual rankings of the world's highest-paid actors.

Born in Los Angeles, DiCaprio began his career in the late 1980s by appearing in television commercials. In the early 1990s, he had recurring roles in various television shows, such as the sitcom Parenthood, and had his first major film part as author Tobias Wolff in This Boy's Life (1993). At age 19, he received critical acclaim and his first Academy Award and Golden Globe Award nominations for his performance as a developmentally disabled boy in What's Eating Gilbert Grape (1993). He achieved international stardom with the star-crossed romances Romeo + Juliet (1996) and Titanic (1997).

After the latter became the highest-grossing film at the time, he reduced his workload for a few years. In an attempt to shed his image of a romantic hero, DiCaprio sought roles in other genres, including crime drama in Catch Me If You Can (2002) and Gangs of New York (2002); the latter marked the first of his many successful collaborations with director Martin Scorsese. DiCaprio portrayed Howard Hughes in The Aviator (2004) and received acclaim for his performances in the political thriller Blood Diamond (2006), the crime drama The Departed (2006), and the romantic drama Revolutionary Road (2008).

In the following decade, DiCaprio starred in several high-profile directors' projects, including the science fiction thriller Inception (2010), the western Django Unchained (2012), the biopic The Wolf of Wall Street (2013), the survival drama The Revenant (2015), for which he won an Academy Award and a BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role, and the comedy-drama Once Upon a Time in Hollywood (2019), all of which were critical and commercial successes.

DiCaprio is the founder of Appian Way Productions, a production company that has produced some of his films and the documentary series Greensburg (2008–2010), and the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation, a nonprofit organization devoted to promoting environmental awareness. He regularly supports charitable causes and has produced several documentaries on the environment.

His parents were very young when they had him; his mother, Heidi, was only 17 and his father, Ramon, 19. Only a year and a half later they had their sister, so they were very young and had two children. For Mario, his father is his ""reference"", while his mother, like his brothers, are his ""confidants"".

His mother has been raising her children, while his father is a cabinetmaker, but has also done construction and renovation work. Because of this work, his father had no problems moving to another city, so they decided to accompany Mario when he left for Madrid and settled with him in the city.

Mario has four other brothers and sisters, forming what he defines as ""a Sicilian family"", a family with many children established around a ""matriarch"". Mario, is the oldest of them all. He is followed by his sister Sheila, and two other brothers, named Christian and Oscar. Finally, the youngest member of the family, Daniel, who was born in 2014, and whom he considers almost as his ""nephew"" because of the enormous age difference.

He gets along well with all of them, although especially with his sister Sheila, as they have grown up together. Mario, a loyal tattoo lover, has one dedicated to each of his parents and siblings, with the initials of each one.

He remembers his childhood as ""wonderful"", although he had a bit of a hard time because he was given ""a lot of cane"" for being short, even the girls. He developed very late, until he was 15 years old, he continued to have the body of a child. Even so, he has always been a flirt, and had his first ""girlfriend"" at the age of 4.

As a child he liked everything: singing, dancing, ping-pong, football.... He says he liked to try everything, although he admits that he got tired fast. His professional career began as an ""advertisement child"", as he was involved in advertising as a child. He advertised Cola Cao, Telepizza, Scalextric... He eventually decided to become an actor after he had enrolled the Cristina Rota School of Dramatic Arts

He also keeps ""lifelong"" friends from school. They are the ones he made when he arrived in Barcelona and have always been with him. In his words, true friends who you can count on the fingers of one hand.

Over the years he dated a few fellow actresses he starred with in movies such as María Valverde and Berta Vázques. Since 2018, he is in a relationship with famous Spanish actress Blanca Suarez he played with in movies/tv shows such as: Carne de Neon (2010), El Barco (2011-2013), Mi Gran Noche (2015), and El Bar (2017).","1986-06-12",,2,,82700,"nm1832584","Acting","Mario Casas","La Coruña, Galicia, Spain",18.665,"/dqXRFhBB4OJQSWonymV8BfVghds.jpg",,,

He has one brother, Silvestre, with whom he starred in Raising Victor Vargas. Rasuk attended performing arts school as a teenager, and began acting at 14. He garnered his first movie role at 16 in Five Feet High and Rising. The film—less than 30 minutes long—was a hit at the Independent Spirit Film Festival. Two years later, the same director, Peter Sollett, suggested expanding the short film into a feature-length movie: Raising Victor Vargas, which went on to win Rasuk an Independent Spirit Award for his work. In his next film, Rock Steady, Rasuk played a character named Roc. Two years later, he took a leading role in Haven with Orlando Bloom. In 2005, Lords of Dogtown was released, with Victor playing Tony Alva, one of the leading roles. The part included surfing and performing skateboarding tricks. Although the more complicated maneuvers were performed by stunt men (including the scenes of surfing at Pacific Ocean Park pier and skating in empty swimming pools), Rasuk is a method actor and worked on remaining in character both on and off screen. Believing he had mastered skating a huge ramp in only his second week of training, Rasuk fractured one of his orbital bones. Rasuk says the accident likely earned him more respect from serious skaters within the cast and crew. Victor can now be seen on the HBO television series How To Make It In America (2010), co-starring alongside Bryan Greenberg and rapper Kid Cudi. Marjorie Ballentine is his acting coach.

Zwick later informed Karl that the studio was to cast the film out of Japan, but encouraged Karl to move to Los Angeles as he saw promise in the young actor's talent. Inspired, Karl moved to Los Angeles, only to learn that he was offered a five year contract back in New York, on the popular daytime TV drama All My Children.

In 1962, Fox was working in a bank when Tony Richardson offered him a minor role in the film The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner. Fox's father attempted to forbid this, claiming that his son had no talent for acting and that it would disrupt his life for him to give up his job in the bank, nevertheless, Fox took the part.

During the 1960s, Fox gained popularity. In 1964, he won a BAFTA Award for Most Promising Newcomer for his role in The Servant (1963).

On 16 June 1965 Ken Annakin's Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines was released. In this British period comedy film, Fox is featured among an international ensemble cast including Stuart Whitman, Sarah Miles, Robert Morley, Terry-Thomas, Red Skelton, Benny Hill, Jean-Pierre Cassel, Gert Fröbe and Alberto Sordi. The film, revolving around the craze of early aviation circa 1910, is about a pompous newspaper magnate (Morley) who is convinced by his daughter (Miles) and fiancée (Fox), a young army officer, and they organize an air race from London to Paris, where he decides to race. A large sum of money is offered to the winner, hence it attracts a variety of characters who participate. The film received positives reviews, described as funny, colourful and clever, and capturing the early enthusiasm for aviation.

It was treated as a major production, one of only three full-length 70 mm Todd-AO Fox releases in 1965 with an intermission and musical interlude part of the original screenings. Because of the Todd-AO process, the film was an exclusive roadshow feature initially shown in deluxe Cinerama venues, where customers needed reserved seats purchased ahead of time. The film grossed $31,111,111 theatrically and on home video $29,950,000.

He is known for providing the voice of Darth Vader in the Star Wars franchise and the tagline for CNN.  James Earl Jones was born in Arkabutla, Mississippi, the son of Ruth (née Connolly) and Robert Earl Jones. At the age of five, he moved to Jackson, Michigan, to be raised by his maternal grandparents, but the adoption was traumatic and he developed a stutter so severe he refused to speak aloud. When he moved to Brethren, Michigan in later years a teacher at the Brethren schools started to help him with his stutter. He remained functionally mute for eight years until he reached high school. He credits his high school teacher, Donald Crouch, who discovered he had a gift for writing poetry, with helping him out of his silence.  Jones attended the University of Michigan where he was a pre-med major. While there, he joined the Reserve Officer Training Corps, and excelled. During the course of his studies, Jones discovered he was not cut out to be a doctor. Instead he focused himself on drama, with the thought of doing something he enjoyed, before, he assumed, he would have to go off to fight in the Korean War. After four years of college, Jones left without his degree. In 1953 he found a part-time stage crew job at the Ramsdell Theatre in Manistee, Michigan, which marked the beginning of his acting career. During the 1955–1957 seasons he was an actor and stage manager. He performed his first portrayal of Shakespeare’s Othello in this theater in 1955. After his discharge from the Military, Jones moved to New York, where he attended the American Theatre Wing to further his training and worked as a janitor to earn a living. His first film role was as a young and trim Lt. Lothar Zogg, the B-52 bombardier in Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb in 1964. His first big role came with his portrayal of boxer Jack Jefferson in the film version of the Broadway play The Great White Hope, which was based on the life of boxer Jack Johnson. For his role, Jones was nominated Best Actor by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, making him the second African-American male performer (following Sidney Poitier) to receive a nomination. In 1969, Jones participated in making test films for a proposed children's television series; these shorts, combined with animated segments were the beginnings of the Sesame Street format. The next year, in the early 1970s, James appeared with Diahann Carroll in the film called Claudine.  While he has appeared in many roles, he is well known as the voice of Darth Vader in the original Star Wars trilogy. Darth Vader was portrayed in costume by David Prowse in the original trilogy, with Jones dubbing Vader's dialogue in postproduction due to Prowse's strong West Country accent being unsuitable for the role. At his own request, he was originally uncredited for the release of the first two films (he would later be credited for the two in the 1997 re-release).  His other voice roles include Mufasa in the 1994 film Disney animated blockbuster The Lion King, and its direct-to-video sequel, The Lion King II: Simba's Pride. He also has done the CNN tagline, ""This is CNN"", as well as ""This is CNN International"", and the Bell Atlantic tagline, ""Bell Atlantic: The heart of communication"". When Bell Atlantic became Verizon, Jones used the tagline greeting of ""Welcome to Verizon"" or ""Verizon 411"" right before a phone call would go through. The opening for NBC's coverage of the 2000 and 2004 Summer Olympics; ""the Big PI in the Sky"" (God) in the computer game Under a Killing Moon; a Claymation film about The Creation; and several guest spots on The Simpsons.

Her studies coincided with shooting of the current instalment of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, where she reprised her role as Parvati Patil.

Born in Cheltenham in 1925, he studied at Oxford University and, in 1949, he joined the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre at Stratford-upon-Avon. Television viewers most fondly remember him as the overbearing Siegfried Farnon in All Creatures Great and Small (1978) but his most critically acclaimed performance was as the title character of Winston Churchill: The Wilderness Years (1981). His portrayal of Britain's wartime leader was so accurately observed that, in the following years, he was called on to reprise the role in such productions as The Woman He Loved (1988) and War and Remembrance (1988).

Unlike some British character actors, Hardy was not a Hollywood name and his work in films was therefore restricted to appearances in predominantly British-based productions such as The Spy Who Came In from the Cold (1965), Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (1994) and Sense and Sensibility (1995). However, in the 21st century, Hardy came to the attention of a whole new generation for his performances in the hugely successful Harry Potter films, while also continuing to make regular appearances in British television series. His co-star from All Creatures Great and Small (1978), Peter Davison, quite simply described Hardy as an ""extraordinary"" actor who would ""never do the same thing twice"" when he was acting with him.
