She survives of food stolen from the castle of the sinister Regent Tristain. One day, to escape his guards, Pil disguises herself as a princess. Thus she embarks upon a mad, delirious adventure, together with Crobar, a big clumsy guard who thinks she's a noble, and Rigolin, a young crackpot jester. Pil is going to have to save Roland, rightful heir to the throne under the curse of a spell. This adventure will turn the entire kingdom upside down, and teach Pil that nobility can be found in all of us.",2264.227,"/abPQVYyNfVuGoFUfGVhlNecu0QG.jpg","[{""id"":28792,""logo_path"":null,""name"":""TAT Productions"",""origin_country"":""FR""},{""id"":2902,""logo_path"":""/nSPZ1BNASeC2dxJKB8AF6dJCx5q.png"",""name"":""SND"",""origin_country"":""FR""},{""id"":591,""logo_path"":""/q5I5RDwMEiqoNmfaJgd2LraEOJY.png"",""name"":""France 3 Cinéma"",""origin_country"":""FR""}]","[{""iso_3166_1"":""FR"",""name"":""France""}]","2021-08-11",3114766,89,"[{""english_name"":""French"",""iso_639_1"":""fr"",""name"":""Français""}]","Released","","Pil's Adventures",false,6.9,60
